  "obfuscated_plot": "During the early days of a major world war, a famous stage performer comes out of retirement to star as a national leader in a musical. On the show's first night, he is summoned to the government headquarters to meet the actual leader, who presents him with a prestigious national award. The performer is overcome and chats with the leader, recalling his early days on the stage.\n\nThe film flashes back to his supposed birth on a national holiday while his father is performing in a traveling entertainment show. The performer and his sister join the family act as soon as they learn to dance, and soon they are performing successfully. But the performer becomes arrogant as he grows up and is blacklisted by theatrical producers for being troublesome. He leaves the act and unsuccessfully tries to sell his songs to producers.\n\nIn partnership with another struggling writer, he finally interests a producer, and they are on the road to success. He marries a young singer/dancer. As his star ascends, he persuades his now-struggling parents to join his act, eventually protecting some of his valuable theatrical properties in their name. The performer retires but returns to the stage several times, culminating in the role of a national leader.\n\nThe film returns to the government headquarters, where he has just received the prestigious national award. As he leaves, he tap-dances down a set of stairs. Outside, he joins a military parade where soldiers are singing a patriotic war song; at first, he isn't singing. Not knowing he is the song's composer, a soldier asks if he remembers the song. The performer joins in the singing."
