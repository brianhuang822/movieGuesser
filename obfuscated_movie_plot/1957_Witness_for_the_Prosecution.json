  "obfuscated_plot": "A senior barrister nearing retirement after a heart attack agrees to defend a man accused of murdering a wealthy, childless widow who had fallen in love with him and named him as the main beneficiary in her will. Despite his nurse's objections and doctor's warnings, he takes on the stressful criminal case. The barrister speaks with the defendant's foreign wife, whom he finds cold and self-possessed; she provides a questionable alibi. During the trial, the prosecution introduces testimony about the victim having seen the defendant with a younger woman, but the barrister believes his client to be innocent.\n\nHe is shocked when the wife is called to testify against her husband. It is revealed that their marriage is invalid, as she was previously married to another man. She states she never loved her current husband and explains their marriage was solely a means for her to escape from a dangerous political territory. According to her testimony, her husband confessed to killing the victim to avoid being disinherited.\n\nWhile fearing his client will be convicted, the barrister is contacted by a woman offering to sell letters written by the wife to a lover. During cross-examination, he reads the letters, which reveal a conspiracy to frame the defendant. The jury acquits him.\n\nHowever, the wife later explains her elaborate plan: she purposely appeared as a hateful, double-crossing spouse and fabricated the letters to discredit her own testimony. She actually loves her husband but knows he is guilty. She overhears him boasting about manipulating and murdering the victim, and plans to abandon her.\n\nDevastated by his betrayal, the wife grabs a knife and fatally stabs her husband. As she is arrested, the barrister decides to delay his retirement to defend her."
