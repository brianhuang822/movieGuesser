  "obfuscated_plot": "A young farm animal is won in a county fair weight-guessing contest and brought home to a rural farm by the contest winner. There, he is taken in by a Border Collie and her family and befriends a duck who wants to prove his usefulness. The duck convinces the farm animal to help him disable an alarm clock, causing household chaos. The farm's sheepdog initially discourages interaction, but the Border Collie adopts the young farm animal.\n\nDuring a family holiday, the farmer decides not to use the young animal for food and instead sees potential for a competition prize. After preventing sheep thieves and demonstrating an unusual ability to interact with farm animals, the young animal begins learning sheep herding. The sheepdog becomes aggressive, attacking the Border Collie and the farmer when challenged.\n\nThe young farm animal successfully protects the sheep from wild dogs but loses an elderly sheep mentor in the process. After learning the truth about animal consumption, he becomes depressed and runs away. The farmer finds him and restores his spirits through gentle care and an impromptu musical performance.\n\nAt a local herding competition, the young animal initially struggles until the previously antagonistic sheepdog helps him by obtaining a secret communication method from the sheep. Using this technique, the farm animal perfectly herds the sheep, winning the competition and earning his farmer's proud acknowledgment."
