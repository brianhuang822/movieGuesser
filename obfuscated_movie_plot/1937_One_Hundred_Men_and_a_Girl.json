  "obfuscated_plot": "A struggling trombone player is one of many unemployed musicians. He tries unsuccessfully to gain an interview with a famous conductor, but to avoid disappointing his daughter, he lies about getting a job with the conductor's orchestra. His daughter learns the truth after sneaking into a rehearsal and discovers her father used money from a lost evening bag to pay his debts. The willful daughter confronts the bag's owner, a wealthy society matron, who casually suggests sponsoring an orchestra of unemployed musicians. Taking her seriously, the daughter and father recruit 100 musicians, rent a space, and begin rehearsing. The matron tries to flee, and her husband tells the musicians he will only sponsor them if they can attract a renowned guest conductor. The determined daughter sets out to recruit the famous conductor, who initially refuses. By accident, she spreads a story to a music critic that the conductor will perform and the radio station will broadcast the concert. Pressured by potential publicity, the station owner signs the orchestra to a contract. The conductor is initially offended but becomes moved when the daughter and orchestra perform for him. He postpones his European tour and agrees to conduct. The concert becomes a huge success, with the daughter surprising everyone by singing an aria during the performance."
