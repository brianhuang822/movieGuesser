  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 19th century, a young lawyer is forcibly expelled from a train carriage despite having a valid first-class ticket, subsequently campaigning for minority equality in a colonial region. A local organization president notices his campaign and invites him to a demonstration. After a war, the colonial government attempts to enact discriminatory laws. The lawyer responds with numerous peaceful demonstrations, eventually leading to some rights being granted.\n\nA clergyman and an international journalist join his mission. The lawyer returns to his home country and is invited to a national political congress, meeting several prominent leaders. He pledges allegiance to the colonial empire while simultaneously demanding self-rule. His peaceful resistance movements are initially suppressed.\n\nA massacre of peaceful protesters by military forces becomes a turning point. The lawyer advocates for non-violent resistance, but when protests turn violent, he calls off the movement. Later, he organizes a symbolic economic protest, leading to his imprisonment.\n\nHe participates in political conferences about the country's future status. During World War II, he and other leaders are imprisoned. His wife dies during this time. Political tensions rise between different religious groups, with some leaders demanding a separate state.\n\nWhen independence is declared, the country is divided, causing massive population movements and severe sectarian violence. Devastated by the bloodshed, the lawyer initiates a peaceful intervention, fasting to stop the violence and advocating for reconciliation between communities.\n\nWhile walking to a prayer meeting, he is assassinated by a political opponent. His funeral becomes a massive national mourning event, with his ashes scattered in a sacred river, symbolizing his enduring legacy of peaceful resistance and national unity."
