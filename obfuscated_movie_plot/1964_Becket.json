  "obfuscated_plot": "A royal advisor and companion to a carousing monarch becomes deeply involved in court intrigue. The king appoints his confidant to a high-ranking position, believing he can fully control him. Initially, the advisor helps the king arrange various indulgences while managing court affairs, which creates resentment among the nobility and royal family members.\n\nTensions arise between the advisor and the monarch when the advisor becomes a religious leader and begins siding with the church, directly opposing the king's political interests. A significant conflict emerges when the advisor excommunicates a loyal noble for executing a priest without proper ecclesiastical trial.\n\nThe king attempts to discredit his former friend through political manipulation, but these efforts fail. The advisor escapes to a neighboring kingdom, finding refuge with a sympathetic foreign monarch who sees an opportunity to undermine the English ruler.\n\nThe religious leader travels to the Vatican, seeking permission to resign, but is encouraged to return and defend church principles. A tenuous reconciliation occurs when they meet, with the advisor expressing complicated loyalty to the king.\n\nHowever, the monarch's resentment grows, fueled by courtiers who highlight the advisor's increasing popularity among the subjugated population. During a drunken moment, the king's frustrated comment is interpreted by his nobles as a call to action.\n\nThe nobles subsequently travel to the advisor's location and murder him. Shocked by the consequences, the king undergoes a public ritual of penance and later ensures the murdered advisor is honored as a heroic figure."
