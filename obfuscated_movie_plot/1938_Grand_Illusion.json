  "obfuscated_plot": "During a major world war, two aviators from one military aviation service, an aristocratic captain and a working-class lieutenant, set out to investigate a blurred reconnaissance photograph. They are shot down by an enemy flying ace and aristocrat, and both are taken prisoner by the opposing army. Upon returning to the airbase, the enemy ace sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, the two aristocratic officers discover they have mutual acquaintancesâ€”a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries. The aviators are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp, where they meet a colorful group of fellow prisoners and stage a vaudeville-type performance just after the enemy has taken a strategically important fort in an epic battle. During the performance, word arrives that their side has recaptured the fort. The lieutenant interrupts the show, and the prisoners spontaneously burst into their national anthem. As a result of the disruption, the lieutenant is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. The officers also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, the lieutenant is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming prisoner from another country. The prisoners are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in a mountain fortress prison commanded by the enemy ace, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. The commander tells them that the fortress is escape-proof. At the new camp, they are reunited with a fellow prisoner, a wealthy man who generously shares the food parcels he receives. One of the officers comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for his companions to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that the sacrificial officer is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the guards away in pursuit. His companions take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee. The commander stops the guards from firing at the sacrificial officer and pleads with his friend to give himself up. The officer refuses, and the commander reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but accidentally and fatally hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving commander, the dying officer laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both cultures is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for the commander, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world. The two fugitives journey across the enemy countryside, trying to reach a neutral country. One of them injures his foot, slowing the other down. They quarrel and part, but then the lieutenant returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a local woman who lost her husband and three brothers in battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories\". She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. The lieutenant and the local woman fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but they eventually leave from a sense of duty after the injured prisoner recovers. The lieutenant declares he will come back to the woman and her young daughter if he survives the war. An enemy patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into neutral territory."
