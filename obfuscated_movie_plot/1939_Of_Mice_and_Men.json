  "obfuscated_plot": "Two migrant field workers during an economic depression, a mentally-challenged man and his protective friend, hope to one day own their own farm. They arrive at a ranch and meet an aged, one-handed worker. After meeting the ranch boss, the pair are confronted by the violent son of the ranch owner. The owner's wife flirts with the other workers, causing tension. The protective friend warns his companion not to interact with her. Another worker offers to help them buy the farm, making their dream seem closer to reality.\n\nA confrontation occurs when the ranch owner's son attacks the mentally-challenged man, who accidentally crushes the son's hand while defending himself. A senior worker intervenes and prevents further conflict. The wife discovers the incident and confronts her husband. She later encounters the mentally-challenged man in a barn, sharing her own unfulfilled dreams. When she allows him to touch her hair, he accidentally kills her by breaking her neck while trying to quiet her struggles.\n\nWhen the body is discovered, a lynch mob forms to hunt the mentally-challenged man. His protective friend finds him first and, wanting to spare him from a brutal death at the hands of the mob, mercifully shoots him in the head before the others can find him."
