Meanwhile, his aunt moves in with his family, creating additional family tension. His mother and friends discourage the relationship, criticizing the woman's appearance and trying to persuade him to remain single.\n\nInfluenced by peer pressure, he fails to call her as promised. Later that evening, he realizes he is giving up a meaningful relationship that makes him genuinely happy. Despite his friends' objections, he rushes to call her. Just before dialing, he turns the tables on his friend by repeating the same marriage pressure he has always received.\n\nThe story concludes with him about to speak to her on the phone, representing a moment of personal transformation and potential romantic connection."
