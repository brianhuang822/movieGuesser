  "obfuscated_plot": "A wealthy socialite is falsely accused of breaking up a marriage and sues a prominent city newspaper for $5 million for libel. The managing editor turns in desperation to a former reporter and suave ladies' man for help. The reporter's scheme is to maneuver the socialite into being alone with him when his \"wife\" shows up, so that the suit will have to be dropped. The reporter is not married, so the editor volunteers his long-suffering fianc√©e to marry the reporter in name only, over her loud protests. The reporter arranges to return to his home country on the same ocean liner as the socialite and her father. He pays some men to pose as reporters and harass the socialite at the dock, so that he can \"rescue\" her and become acquainted. On the voyage, the socialite initially treats him with contempt, assuming that he is just the latest in a long line of fortune hunters after her money, but the reporter gradually overcomes her suspicions. Complications arise when the socialite and reporter actually fall in love. They get married, but the \"wife\" decides that she prefers the reporter to a marriage-averse journalist and interrupts their honeymoon to reclaim her husband. The reporter reveals that he found out that the \"wife\" was married before and that her previous divorce was invalid, thus rendering their own marriage invalid. But the \"wife\" reveals she obtained a second divorce, so she and the reporter are legally husband and wife. The socialite and reporter manage to show the \"wife\" that she really loves the editor."
