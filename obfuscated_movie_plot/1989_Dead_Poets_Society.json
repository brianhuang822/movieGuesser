He is assigned a top-performing roommate, and through him, meets a group of friends. Their new English teacher introduces unconventional teaching methods that challenge the students to think independently and embrace individuality. The teacher encourages them to pursue their passions and look at life from different perspectives.\n\nInspired by the teacher, the students form a secret literary club where they read poetry and share their dreams. One student falls in love with acting and pursues a role in a local theater production, despite his strict father's disapproval. Another student develops confidence and discovers his creative potential through the teacher's mentorship.\n\nWhen the students begin to challenge the school's traditional systems, tensions rise. The headmaster becomes increasingly concerned about the teacher's influence. After the aspiring actor performs in a play, his father's severe reaction leads to a tragic suicide.\n\nIn the aftermath, the school administration investigates the incident. One student betrays his classmates by blaming the teacher, leading to his dismissal. Under pressure from their families, most students sign a document supporting these false accusations.\n\nDuring the teacher's final moment in the classroom, one student finds the courage to stand up in solidarity, inspiring other students to do the same. The teacher is moved by their support as he is forced to leave the school, symbolizing a small but powerful act of rebellion against institutional conformity."
