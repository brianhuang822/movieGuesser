  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1960s in a Southern city during the era of racial segregation, a young African-American student appears destined for great things academically. His Black teacher encourages him to think critically and challenge historical narratives. Raised by his grandmother, whose father died under suspicious circumstances in prison, the student becomes involved in the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nAfter being accepted into a tuition-free advanced study program, he is wrongfully convicted of a crime while hitchhiking and sent to a segregated reform school. The school is brutally divided by race, with White students receiving preferential treatment while Black students are subjected to harsh conditions and forced labor. The White superintendent maintains a facade of rehabilitation while secretly exploiting the students.\n\nThe protagonist befriends another student with a more cynical worldview. While the protagonist remains committed to non-violent ideals, his friend is skeptical of societal justice. The school administration routinely abuses students, and the protagonist's attempts to seek help are met with further violence.\n\nIn later years, the protagonist builds a life in a large northern city, running a moving business. Decades later, he discovers unmarked graves at the former school site, revealing a history of systematic violence against Black students.\n\nReturning to the past, the protagonist creates a detailed record of the school's abuses and attempts to expose the corruption. When the school discovers his plans, they move to silence him. His friend attempts a rescue, and they try to escape together. During their flight, the protagonist is killed, and his friend ultimately assumes his identity, moving North and trying to honor his friend's memory and ideals.\n\nWhen government investigations begin into the school's past, the surviving friend decides to testify about the systemic racism and violence they experienced."
