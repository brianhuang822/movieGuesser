  "obfuscated_plot": "In a Native American reservation during the early 20th century, tribal elders mourn their cultural loss while discovering vast oil wealth beneath their land. The tribe becomes unexpectedly prosperous, but local legal systems require white guardians to manage their finances, treating them as incompetent.\n\nA recently returned war veteran moves in with his brother and uncle, who is a local law enforcement officer and rancher. The uncle secretly orchestrates a series of murders targeting wealthy tribal members. The veteran marries a local Native woman from a prominent oil-owning family, and they have children together.\n\nThe uncle systematically plans the killings of the woman's family members, believing he will inherit more wealth through these deaths. As her relatives mysteriously die, the woman becomes increasingly vulnerable. Her family members grow suspicious of the white community and fear potential violence.\n\nThe veteran is manipulated by his uncle into arranging multiple murders, including those of his wife's relatives. Despite local law enforcement's complicity, a federal investigator begins uncovering the conspiracy. The woman, critically ill from apparent poisoning, seeks help from national authorities.\n\nThe federal agent ultimately arrests the uncle and the veteran. The wife is saved through medical intervention, and the veteran testifies against his uncle to protect his remaining family. Though convicted, both men are eventually paroled. The wife separates from her husband, and years later, many details of the murders remain obscured by local legal systems."
