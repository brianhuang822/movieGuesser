  "obfuscated_plot": "At a rural countryside fairground, a paramilitary volunteer and a unit of other militant members, led by their leader, kidnap a soldier from an opposing military after a female member of their unit lures the soldier to a secluded area by promising sex. The unit intends to hold the soldier until a imprisoned member is released, and if their demands are not met within three days, he will be executed. As the guard stands watch over the soldier, the two begin to bond, and the soldier shares a fable about a scorpion and a frog. Aware that he may not survive, the soldier asks the guard to promise to find his girlfriend and check on her well-being. When the captors' deadline passes without their demands being met, the guard is ordered to take the soldier into the woods to kill him. However, instead of shooting him, the guard chases the soldier when he attempts to escape. As the soldier flees, he runs into the road and is struck and killed by an armoured personnel carrier. The military attacks the militant unit, and the guard manages to escape, believing his companions have perished in the attack. He flees to a large city, assuming a new identity and finding work as a day labourer.\n\nA few months later, the guard finds the girlfriend at a hair salon, where the soldier had told him that she works as a stylist. He follows her to a bar, and they flirt using the barman as an intermediary. They develop a relationship, and in time the guard falls in love with her. Later, they are about to become intimate. The girlfriend undresses, and the guard sees her male genitalia. Initially repulsed, he hits her in the face and leaves her apartment. After some reflection, he apologizes in a note, and they reconcile.\n\nAround the same time, a female militant reappears and coerces the guard into helping with an assassination plot against a judge, using the threat of harm to the girlfriend to ensure his cooperation. The guard continues to woo her, disguising her as a boy to protect her. The night before the mission, the girlfriend gets drunk and the guard stays with her. He confesses his role in the soldier's death, but an intoxicated girlfriend appears not to fully comprehend his words.\n\nIn the morning, the girlfriend restrains the guard, preventing him from completing the assassination. An angry militant leader manages to shoot the judge but is shot and killed by the judge's bodyguards. The female militant, seeking revenge, enters the girlfriend's flat with a gun. The girlfriend manages to overpower her and shoots her dead after learning of her involvement in the soldier's death. She then points the gun at the guard but spares him, stating that the soldier would not want her to kill him. The guard prevents her from killing herself and allows her to escape. He wipes her fingerprints from the gun and takes the blame for the female militant's murder.\n\nMonths later, the girlfriend visits the guard in prison and asks why he took the fall for her. He responds, \"As a man once said, it's in my nature,\" and begins to recount the story of the scorpion and the frog."
