Meanwhile, the female monarch, ruling in her own right, is frustrated with her subjects' constant speculation about her potential marriage. Intrigued by the officer's controversial record, she invites him to dinner to determine an appropriate punishment. Their interaction evolves romantically, ultimately leading to marriage, with the officer agreeing to become her consort out of love. However, he soon becomes restless with the limited role of a royal spouse, feeling constrained by the lack of meaningful responsibilities and finding himself compelled to take independent action."
