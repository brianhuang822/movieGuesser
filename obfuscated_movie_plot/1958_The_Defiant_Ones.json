  "obfuscated_plot": "One night in the late 1950s in a rural Southern region, a truck loaded with prisoners swerves to avoid another truck and crashes through a barrier. The rescuers clear up the debris and discover two prisoners have escaped, an African-American man shackled to a white man because \"the warden had a sense of humor.\" They are told not to look too hard as \"they will probably kill each other before they go five miles.\" Nevertheless, a large posse and many bloodhounds are dispatched the next morning to find them. The two missing men are a black prisoner and a white prisoner. Despite their mutual hatred, they are forced to cooperate, as they are chained together. At first, their co-operation is motivated by self-preservation, but gradually they begin to respect and like each other. The prisoners flee through difficult terrain and weather, with a brief stop at a turpentine camp where they attempt to break into a general store, in hopes of obtaining food and tools to break the chain. Instead, they are captured by the inhabitants, who form a lynch mob; they are saved only by the interference of an older man who is appalled by his neighbors' bloodthirst. The man persuades the onlookers to lock the convicts up and turn them in the next morning. That night, he secretly releases them, being a former chain-gang prisoner himself. Finally, they run into a young boy. They make him take them to his home and his mother, whose husband has abandoned his family. The escapees finally are able to break their chains. When they spend the night there, the lonely woman is attracted to the white prisoner and wants to run off with him. She advises the black prisoner to go through the swamp to reach the railroad tracks while she and the white prisoner will drive off in her car. However, after the black prisoner leaves, the woman reveals that she had lied: She has sent him into the dangerous swamp to die to eliminate any chance he would be captured and reveal where the white prisoner had gone. Furious, the white prisoner runs after his friend; as he leaves, the boy shoots him. Wounded, the white prisoner catches up with the black prisoner and warns him about the swamp. The posse led by a humane sheriff gets close. The two hear a train whistle and run toward it. The black prisoner catches up to the train and jumps aboard. The white prisoner runs alongside, desperately trying to catch up. The black prisoner calls to the white prisoner and holds out his hand. Their hands clasp, but the black prisoner is unable to pull the white prisoner aboard. Both men tumble to the ground. Too exhausted to run, they realize all they can do is wait for their pursuers. The sheriff finds the black prisoner singing defiantly and the white prisoner lying in his arms."
