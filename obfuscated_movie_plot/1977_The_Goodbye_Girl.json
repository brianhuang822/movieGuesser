  "obfuscated_plot": "A dancer and divorcee lives in a large city apartment with her married boyfriend, who suddenly leaves to pursue a film role in another country. Before departing, he sublets the apartment to a quirky aspiring actor from a midwestern city, who arrives unexpectedly in the middle of the night. The woman, who is demanding and cynical, reluctantly allows the actor to move in. She is struggling to restart her dance career, while the actor has landed a lead role in an experimental theatre production of a classic historical play. The director wants him to portray the lead character as an exaggerated stereotype, which the actor reluctantly accepts despite potential career risks. Theatre critics harshly criticize the performance, causing the actor to get depressed and drink. Despite their frequent conflicts, the two eventually fall in love and become intimate. The woman's young daughter is initially skeptical of their relationship, having been hurt by previous romantic disappointments. The actor wins over the daughter by demonstrating his genuine care and commitment. He subsequently gets offered a film role in a distant state, which causes the woman to fear he will abandon her like previous men in her life. However, he calls her and invites her to join him, and she realizes his love is genuine when he asks her to care for his prized personal possession before leaving."
