  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century, in a small town in a developing country, two American laborers are hired by a contractor to work on oil rigs. After completing their work, the contractor disappears without paying them. Penniless, they meet an elderly prospector who shares stories about gold mining. They confront the contractor, beating him and recovering their owed wages. After winning a small lottery, they team up with the prospector and set out to search for gold in a remote mountain range.\n\nAfter fending off a bandit attack, they find a promising site and begin mining, accumulating a substantial fortune. Growing distrust emerges, particularly from one of the laborers who becomes increasingly paranoid. During a supply trip, another prospector follows them and proposes joining their operation. Before they can decide, a gang of bandits attacks, killing the newcomer.\n\nThey discover a letter revealing the newcomer's personal struggles, and two of them agree to share their earnings with his widow. Later, one of the prospectors is called to a nearby village to help a sick child. While he is away, tensions escalate between the remaining men. One attempts to murder the other and flee with all the gold.\n\nThe attempted murder victim survives and is rescued. The murderer is later killed by the bandits, who discard the gold, mistaking it for sand. The wind scatters the treasure. The bandits are captured and executed. The two survivors reunite and discover the gold is lost, ultimately sharing a moment of ironic laughter. One decides to stay in the village, while the other plans to return home and help the widow of their fallen companion."
