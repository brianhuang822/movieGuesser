  "obfuscated_plot": "An elderly man with dementia visits his daughter in his apartment after driving away multiple caregivers. He is convinced a caregiver stole his watch and refuses to leave his home. His daughter tells him she is moving to another country to be with a new partner, which confuses him since he does not remember her previous marriage. She warns that if he continues refusing care, he will be moved to a nursing home.\n\nThe next day, he encounters an unfamiliar man in his apartment who claims to be his son-in-law and says the elderly man is actually living in his daughter's home. When the daughter returns, she appears to him as a different woman. A new caregiver arrives for an interview, and he tells her he was a professional dancer who needs no assistance. He mentions another daughter he hasn't seen in a long time.\n\nAs the story progresses, it becomes clear that he has actually been living with his daughter for years but believes he is still in his own apartment. His daughter and her husband argue about cancelled plans and her sacrifices in caring for her father. The husband becomes increasingly frustrated, at one point physically confronting the elderly man.\n\nThe man eventually finds himself in a hospital hallway, remembering a traumatic memory of his other daughter injured. He then wakes up in a nursing home, with a nurse informing him that his daughter lives in another country and visits occasionally. He becomes deeply distressed, unable to comprehend his situation, and expresses a childlike desire for his mother while metaphorically describing his sense of disintegration. The nurse comforts him and promises to take him to the park later."
