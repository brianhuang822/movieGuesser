The next morning, a local newspaper assigns a new reporter to cover the story. He learns the five men have intelligence agency connections and sophisticated surveillance equipment.\n\nThe reporter connects the burglars to high-level government officials and is partnered with another journalist.

He warns that the conspiracy involves multiple intelligence agencies and puts the reporters' lives at risk. When they share their findings with their editor, he recognizes the potential for a major constitutional crisis.\n\nDuring the president's second inauguration, the reporters compile their complete story.
