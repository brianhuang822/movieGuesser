  "obfuscated_plot": "A historical comedy follows the marital life of a powerful monarch during the middle of his reign, chronicling his tumultuous relationships with six wives over eleven years. In the aftermath of executing his second wife, the king quickly marries a third wife who dies shortly after giving birth. He then weds a foreign princess who strategically arranges her own divorce by deliberately appearing unappealing, allowing her to pursue her true romantic desires. The king next marries a beautiful and ambitious young noblewoman who has previously rejected love. However, she falls in love with a handsome courtier with whom she had a prior romantic history. When their affair is discovered, both are executed for their betrayal. The aging monarch then marries a final wife who proves to be strong-willed and domineering. In the film's concluding moment, while alone, the king directly addresses the audience, wryly commenting on his multiple marriages with a sardonic observation about the complicated nature of his romantic relationships."
