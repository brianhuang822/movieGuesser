She gets a job at a local cafe, where a famous vocal coach hears her sing. The coach promises to make her a star if she allows him to control her life, warning her that romance would distract from developing her talent.

While traveling, they encounter one of the coach's former students, a woman who previously tried to pursue a romantic relationship with him. This encounter makes the singer jealous, and she pretends to be ill. Believing the coach might be rekindling an old romance, she visits a longtime male friend who has proposed marriage.

Later, the former student lies to the singer about her ongoing relationship with the coach, creating more tension.
