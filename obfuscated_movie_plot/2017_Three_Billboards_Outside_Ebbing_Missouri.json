  "obfuscated_plot": "In a small rural town, a grieving mother is mourning the rape and murder of her teenage daughter seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts messages challenging the local police chief about the unsolved case. Many townspeople are upset by the billboards, particularly because the police chief is battling terminal cancer. The chief visits her to persuade her to take them down, but is unsuccessful.\n\nA prejudiced and immature police officer who idolizes the chief tries to intimidate the billboard rental agent and creates additional harassment for the mother. Tensions escalate when the mother confronts various people, including her dentist and her estranged ex-husband. The police chief, knowing his death is imminent, spends a final day with his family and commits suicide to spare them from watching his prolonged decline.\n\nThe grieving officer reacts violently to his mentor's death, assaulting people and getting fired. Before his death, the chief wrote letters to various people, including the mother, revealing his dedication to solving her daughter's case and secretly ensuring the billboards remain up.\n\nAfter the billboards are destroyed by arson, the mother retaliates by burning the police station. A reformed officer who was inside manages to escape with the case file. Eventually, this officer overhears a potential suspect bragging about a similar crime and begins investigating.\n\nThe mother and the officer, both seeking justice and redemption, ultimately decide to embark on a potentially dangerous journey to confront the suspected criminal, uncertain of their final course of action but united in their pursuit of resolution."
