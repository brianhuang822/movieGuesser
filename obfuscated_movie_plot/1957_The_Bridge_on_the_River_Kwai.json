  "obfuscated_plot": "During a conflict in the mid-20th century, a group of prisoners of war, led by a senior officer, arrive at a prison camp in a tropical jungle. A naval commander describes the harsh conditions to the senior officer, who initially forbids escape attempts due to previous surrender orders. The camp commandant informs the prisoners they will be forced to construct a bridge for a railway line, threatening to shoot officers who refuse manual labor. After a standoff and punishment, the senior officer is eventually released and surprisingly becomes determined to build an excellent bridge as a testament to his army's capabilities, despite objections from the medical officer. Meanwhile, an escaped prisoner is recruited by a military officer for a covert mission to destroy the bridge. A small team parachutes into the region, facing casualties and challenges. Under darkness, two commandos plant explosives at the bridge's base, planning to destroy it and an approaching train. At dawn, their plan is complicated when the river level drops, exposing their sabotage equipment. The senior officer discovers the plot, and in the ensuing confrontation, multiple soldiers are killed. Ultimately, the bridge is destroyed when the senior officer, wounded and seemingly in shock, falls onto the detonator as the train approaches, causing it to plunge into the river. The surviving military officer justifies the mission, while a witness declares the entire scenario as complete madness."
