  "obfuscated_plot": "A retired wealthy advisor arrives in the capital city to assist with housing issues and finds himself without accommodations. After placing an ad, he convinces a reluctant young woman to let him share her apartment. He subsequently rents half of his space to a military sergeant waiting to be deployed overseas. The young woman, initially engaged to a pompous government official, becomes increasingly attracted to the sergeant despite her initial resistance.\n\nThe retired advisor, believing the sergeant is a better match for the woman, manipulates circumstances to bring them closer together. He reads her private diary to the sergeant and creates situations that allow them to spend time alone. Despite the woman's engagement, she grows more interested in the sergeant.\n\nComplications arise when the sergeant is mistakenly accused of being a foreign spy by federal agents. During questioning, the woman's fianc√© learns of their living arrangement and becomes concerned about potential scandal. The retired advisor initially denies knowing them to protect his reputation.\n\nTo avoid public embarrassment, the advisor suggests the couple marry quickly and then immediately annul the marriage. With limited time before the sergeant's deployment, they travel to a neighboring state to wed. The advisor has deliberately arranged for the wall between their bedrooms to be removed, facilitating their growing intimacy.\n\nThe plot concludes with the couple married, the engagement broken, and the retired advisor triumphantly changing the apartment's nameplate to reflect their new status."
