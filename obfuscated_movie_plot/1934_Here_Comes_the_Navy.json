  "obfuscated_plot": "A skilled riveter and his best friend join the naval military to antagonize the riveter's nemesis, a senior naval officer. The riveter gets himself court-martialed for being absent without leave while visiting the officer's sister. Frustrated by his treatment, he criticizes the military and becomes isolated by his fellow sailors aboard a naval vessel. During gunnery practice, he puts out a fire in a gun turret and receives a prestigious military medal, but remains determined to leave the service. Later, he transfers to the naval air service and is assigned to a rigid airship. When the airship attempts to dock, the senior officer is accidentally caught on a guide rope and hoisted into the air. Despite direct orders, the riveter climbs down the rope and saves the officer's life by parachuting both of them to the ground. At the riveter's wedding to the officer's sister, it is revealed that he has been promoted to a higher rank, now outranking his former nemesis."
