  "obfuscated_plot": "A foreign woman arrives to teach at a girls school in a different country. She is confronted by tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story. The woman was previously employed as a governess to the four children of a noble couple in a European city during the final years of a monarchy. As a result of the wife's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the husband remains with his wife for the sake of their children. The governess, with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the wife refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The husband confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her. The nobleman is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for his employee, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the nobleman takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for the governess, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, an elderly man who had warned the governess to leave the household. With the nobleman's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that the governess solicited the murder and she is released from prison. The governess had been recommended for the teaching position in her new country by a foreign clergyman, to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that she will accept."
