  "obfuscated_plot": "In a small coastal town known for its summer tourism, a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim. An unseen predator attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partial remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the medical examiner concludes it was a shark attack, the local police chief plans to close the beaches. The town mayor persuades him to reconsider, fearing economic damage. The medical examiner, apparently under pressure, now claims it was a boating accident. The police chief reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy is killed at a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur hunting frenzy. A local eccentric shark hunter offers his services. A consulting marine biologist examines the victim's remains, confirming she was killed by an unusually large shark. When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, the mayor declares the beaches safe. A skeptical biologist dissects the shark and, finding no human remains, concludes the killer shark is still active.\n\nAfter a series of further attacks, the police chief convinces the reluctant mayor to hire the shark hunter. Despite initial tensions between the hunter, the biologist, and the chief's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea to hunt the shark. After several encounters and dramatic confrontations, the shark attacks their boat, destroying it and killing the hunter. In a final desperate moment, the police chief manages to kill the shark by shooting a pressurized tank in its mouth, causing a massive explosion. The marine biologist, who had earlier escaped underwater, resurfaces, and he and the chief paddle back to shore on floating debris."
