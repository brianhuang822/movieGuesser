  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1935, a corrections officer oversees the death row section of a state prison, alongside fellow officers, including one particularly sadistic guard protected by political connections. The guards supervise three prisoners: one frequently tormented by the cruel guard; a violent and erratic inmate; and a large, gentle, simple-minded African-American man convicted of raping and murdering two young girls after being found distraught while cradling their bodies. The prisoner asserts that he tried to \"take it back\", but could not. The lead officer grows doubtful about the prisoner's guilt and soon discovers he possesses miraculous healing abilities. The prisoner cures the officer's crippling bladder infection by absorbing it into himself before expelling it as flies, explaining that he \"took it back\". After the cruel guard crushes another prisoner's pet mouse, the prisoner urgently requests the body and resurrects it, further convincing the guards of his powers.\n\nThe officers manipulate the cruel guard into officiating an execution by promising him a job at a mental asylum afterward. During the execution, the guard deliberately causes an agonizing death. The prisoner senses and is overwhelmed by the pain, inadvertently transferring some of his power into the mouse. The officers secretly take the prisoner to heal the warden's terminally ill wife. They confine the cruel guard and sneak the prisoner out of the prison. The prisoner absorbs the wife's illness, restoring her health, but is left in severe pain from containing it within him.\n\nUpon returning, the prisoner transfers the illness into the cruel guard, who then shoots another violent prisoner while in a possessed state. The lead officer demands answers, and the prisoner transfers memories revealing the violent prisoner's true guilt for the crimes. The cruel guard is left catatonic and institutionalized.\n\nThough convinced of the prisoner's innocence, the officer cannot prevent the execution. He offers the prisoner a chance to escape, but the prisoner, exhausted by constantly sensing human suffering, chooses to die. His last request is to watch a movie, which he has never seen before. During his execution, he shares a final dream of peace with the victims.\n\nIn 1999, the now-elderly officer, aged 108, recounts the story to a friend, revealing it was his last execution before transferring to juvenile corrections. The friend is stunned to learn the prisoner's pet mouse is still alive. The officer views his extreme longevity as a punishment for allowing the prisoner's execution, lamenting the weight of that decision."
