The conservatory's demanding conductor recruits him to play in the studio ensemble as an alternate drummer. The conductor is initially encouraging but quickly becomes relentlessly strict and abusive towards his students. When the drummer seemingly fails to keep tempo during a rehearsal, the conductor becomes verbally and physically aggressive.\n\nDetermined to impress the conductor, the drummer practices excessively, often until his hands blister and bleed. He briefly becomes romantically involved with a woman but breaks up with her to focus on his musical ambitions. After a series of challenging rehearsals and competitions, the drummer experiences several setbacks, including being demoted and replaced.\n\nA tragic incident involving a former band member reveals the conductor's harsh teaching methods. The drummer gets into a severe car accident while rushing to a competition but still attempts to perform, only to be dismissed from the band after a confrontational moment on stage.\n\nWith the help of a lawyer representing the family of a deceased former band member, the drummer anonymously testifies against the conductor, leading to the conductor's termination. Months later, they unexpectedly meet at a jazz club, where the conductor explains his motivational philosophy.\n\nThe conductor invites the drummer to perform at a prestigious jazz festival. Initially setting him up to fail by introducing an unfamiliar song, the conductor appears to have the upper hand. However, the drummer dramatically reclaims the stage, performing an extraordinary improvised solo that ultimately impresses the conductor, who gives a subtle nod of approval."
