He is desperate to regain relevance by writing, directing, and starring in a stage adaptation of a famous short story. The actor's internal superhero voice wants him to return to blockbuster films, insisting he is essential to his identity.\n\nThe play is being produced by his best friend and lawyer, and co-stars his girlfriend and a volatile method actor. His estranged daughter, a recovering drug addict, works as his assistant. After his original co-star is unexpectedly replaced, the preview performances are disastrous, with the method actor causing multiple disruptions.\n\nThe actor experiences personal conflicts with the method actor and his daughter, who criticizes him for his self-centered motivations. During a chaotic final preview, he accidentally locks himself out of the theater and must walk through a busy city street in his underwear, which unexpectedly goes viral.\n\nA influential theater critic promises to destroy his play before even seeing it. On opening night, the performance goes exceptionally well. In his dressing room, he confesses past personal struggles to his ex-wife, including a previous suicide attempt.\n\nDuring the play's climax, he appears to shoot himself on stage. He awakens in the hospital with a reconstructed nose, and the critic has published a glowing review, misinterpreting his suicide attempt as an innovative acting technique.\n\nHis daughter creates a social media account for him, which gains significant popularity. In the final scene, fascinated by birds outside his hospital window, he climbs out onto the ledge. When his daughter returns, she looks out the window and smiles at what she sees."
