  "obfuscated_plot": "In a large city, a war veteran takes a job as a night-shift taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia and loneliness, frequently visiting adult movie theaters and keeping a diary. He becomes disgusted with the crime and urban decay that he witnesses and dreams about getting \"the scum off the streets\". The driver becomes infatuated with a campaign worker for a political candidate. He asks her to join him for coffee, to which she agrees. She agrees to a second date, during which he takes her to an adult movie theater, which she leaves immediately. He attempts to reconcile with her, but fails. Enraged, he storms into her workplace and berates her before being kicked out. Experiencing an existential crisis and seeing various acts of prostitution throughout the city, he confides in a fellow taxi driver about his violent thoughts. However, the other driver dismisses them and assures him that he will be fine. To find an outlet for his rage, he follows an intense physical training regimen. He gets in contact with a black market gun dealer and buys four handguns. At home, he practices drawing his weapons, going as far as creating a quick-draw firearm hidden in his sleeve. He begins attending the candidate's rallies to scope out his security. One night, he shoots a man attempting to rob a convenience store run by his friend, leaving before the cops arrive. In his trips around the city, he regularly encounters a young child prostitute. Tricking her pimp and abusive lover into thinking that he wants to solicit her, he meets with her in private and tries to persuade her to stop prostituting herself. Soon, he shaves his hair into a distinctive style and attends a public rally where he plans to assassinate the candidate. However, security agents see him putting his hand inside his jacket and approach him, which escalates to a chase. He escapes pursuit and makes it home undetected. That evening, he drives to the brothel where the young girl works to kill her pimp. He enters the building and shoots the pimp and one of the girl's clients, a criminal. He is shot several times but manages to kill the two men. He fights with the bouncer, whom he manages to stab through the hand with his knife and kill with a gunshot to the head. He attempts to die by suicide, but has no bullets. Severely injured, he slumps on a couch next to a sobbing girl. As police respond to the scene, he mimics shooting himself in the head with his bloody finger. He goes into a coma due to his injuries, but he is heralded by the press as a heroic vigilante and not prosecuted for the murders. He receives a letter from the girl's parents from another city, who thank him and reveal that she is safe and attending school. After recovering, he returns to work, where he encounters the campaign worker as a fare. She tells him that she followed his story in the newspapers. He drops her at her home but declines to take her money, driving off with a smile. He becomes agitated after noticing something in his rearview mirror, but continues driving into the night."
