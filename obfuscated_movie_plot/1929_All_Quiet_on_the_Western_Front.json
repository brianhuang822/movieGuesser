  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early days of a global war, a passionate teacher delivers an inspiring speech to his young male students about the glory of defending their homeland. On the cusp of manhood, the boys, led by a young idealist, enlist in the army as part of a new military company. Their romantic delusions are quickly shattered during their brief but rigorous training under an abusive sergeant. The new soldiers arrive at a chaotic combat zone, where they find themselves under artillery attack before reaching their post. Their unit consists of older, unwelcoming veterans, and, being hungry, they trade with a veteran corporal for a meal of stolen meat.\n\nThe boys' first mission is a harrowing experience, with multiple soldiers dying from combat and psychological trauma. After a brutal battle with heavy losses, the company receives double food rations due to the high number of casualties. The soldiers begin discussing the causes of war during a meal break. The abusive sergeant arrives at the front, is shunned by his fellow soldiers, and is killed after displaying cowardice.\n\nThe young protagonist stabs an enemy soldier and becomes deeply distressed after spending a night trapped with the slowly dying man, begging for forgiveness. Upon returning to his lines, he is comforted by a veteran mentor. During a march, he and a close friend are severely wounded by artillery and sent to a hospital. Despite being placed in a ward with a reputation for fatal outcomes, he miraculously recovers.\n\nDuring a home furlough, he is shocked by the civilian population's uninformed and optimistic view of the war. When asked to speak at his former school, he unexpectedly expresses his disillusionment, causing his former students to call him a coward. He returns to the front, finding the company now filled with even younger recruits.\n\nReuniting with his mentor, they share a warm moment before a bomb breaks the mentor's leg. While carrying him to a field hospital, another explosion kills the mentor. Devastated by the loss, the protagonist returns to the front line. In a tragic final moment, he reaches out to touch a butterfly beyond his fortification and is killed by an enemy sniper. The narrative concludes with an image of a veterans' cemetery, showing the young soldiers arriving at the front for the first time."
