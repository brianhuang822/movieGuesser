During their trip, the veteran reveals his goals: enjoy luxurious experiences, visit his brother, have an intimate encounter with a woman, and then die by suicide. At a family dinner, tensions rise when the veteran's nephew reveals a traumatic truth about how the veteran became blind. The veteran shows growing affection for the student by defending him.\n\nThe veteran advises the student to become an informant at school to protect his own interests. During their trip, the veteran demonstrates various skills, including seducing a woman and convincing a car salesman to let him test drive a convertible. When the veteran becomes depressed and attempts to walk into traffic, the student intervenes and prevents him from ending his life.\n\nAt the school's disciplinary hearing, the student faces potential expulsion. The veteran unexpectedly arrives and delivers a passionate speech defending the student's integrity. The disciplinary committee ultimately places the original pranksters on probation and excuses the student from further proceedings.
