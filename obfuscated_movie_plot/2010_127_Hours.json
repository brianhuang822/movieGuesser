  "obfuscated_plot": "A dedicated mountaineer goes hiking in a remote national park without telling anyone. He befriends lost hikers and gives them directions. After showing them an underground pool and saying goodbye, he continues exploring a narrow canyon. While climbing, a massive boulder comes loose, trapping his right arm against a rock wall. Realizing he is alone, he attempts to move the boulder but fails. \n\nOver the next five days, he rations his limited food and water, struggling to survive. He records video diaries to maintain morale and attempts to create escape mechanisms. During this time, he experiences hallucinations about his relationships, past experiences, and potential future. He becomes increasingly desperate and depressed.\n\nOn the sixth day, a vision of his future child renews his determination to survive. Using his technical knowledge and available tools, he makes the horrific decision to break and amputate his trapped arm. After freeing himself, he rappels down a rockface, finds water, and continues through the desert.\n\nEventually, he encounters a hiking family who helps him. Authorities rescue him and transport him to a hospital. Years later, he marries, has a child, and continues pursuing his passion for climbing, always ensuring he leaves detailed information about his whereabouts with his family."
