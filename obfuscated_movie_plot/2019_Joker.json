  "obfuscated_plot": "A struggling party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian with a neurological disorder lives with his mother in a decaying urban environment plagued by economic hardship. After being attacked while working, a co-worker provides him a weapon for self-defense. He pursues a relationship with a single mother neighbor and invites her to his comedy routine. After being fired from his job, he is assaulted on public transit while in clown makeup and fatally shoots three businessmen in what he claims is self-defense.\n\nThe killings generate public support, with supporters wearing clown masks. Budget cuts eliminate his medical support, leaving him without necessary medication. After discovering potentially fraudulent information about his parentage, he confronts a wealthy business and political figure who denies being his father. He learns his mother fabricated stories about their relationship and background.\n\nDiscovering his perceived relationships were imaginary, he becomes increasingly unstable. He murders his mother and is invited to appear on a popular late-night talk show. Before the appearance, he kills a former co-worker while sparing another. During the live broadcast, he confesses to previous murders, criticizes societal inequality, and ultimately kills the show's host.\n\nHis actions spark citywide riots. During the chaos, a separate incident results in the murder of a prominent wealthy family in front of their young child. The protagonist is freed from police custody by rioters and celebrates among the crowd. The story concludes with him in a mental institution, cryptically laughing about an untold joke while leaving bloody footprints."
