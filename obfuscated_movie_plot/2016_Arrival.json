  "obfuscated_plot": "A linguist's daughter dies at a young age from an incurable illness. Twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft hover over various locations around the planet. In the ensuing widespread panic, affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them. A military colonel recruits the linguist and a physicist to study the craft in a remote location. On board, they make contact with two cephalopod-like, seven-limbed aliens. They research the complex written language of the aliens, consisting of phrases written with logograms, and share the results with other nations. As the linguist studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter. When she establishes sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the aliens have come, they answer with a statement that could be translated as \"offer weapon\". Another nation interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting them to break off communications, and other nations follow. The linguist argues that the symbol can be more abstractly related to the concepts of \"means\" or \"tool\". Rogue soldiers plant a bomb in the alien craft. Unaware, the linguist and physicist reenter the vessel, and the aliens give them a more complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects them from the vessel. When they wake, the alien craft has moved beyond reach and the military is preparing to evacuate. Another nation issues an ultimatum to the alien craft, demanding it leave within 24 hours. Other countries follow suit; communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. The physicist discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3D space into which it is projected. The linguist suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the aliens want all the nations to collaborate to decipher it. One alien has been mortally injured as a result of the explosion. The other explains that they have come to help humanity because in 3,000 years' time they will need humanity's help in return. The linguist realizes the \"weapon\" is their language. Learning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events. Her visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. She returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells the physicist that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\". She has a premonition of a global event celebrating unity achieved by deciphering the aliens' language. At the event, a military leader thanks her for persuading him to stop the attack when she called his private number and recited his wife's dying words. In the present, she calls the leader's private number to recite the words. The nation announces they are standing down and releasing their portion of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve spacecraft depart. From what she has learned, she writes and publishes a book about the alien language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the aliens. During the evacuation, the physicist expresses his love for her. They talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end. She knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate: that the child will die from an incurable disease and that he will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this."
