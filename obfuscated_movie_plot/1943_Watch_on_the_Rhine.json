  "obfuscated_plot": "A German engineer, his American wife, and their three children cross the border into the United States to visit her brother and mother in the capital city. For years, the family has lived in Europe, where the engineer responded to the rise of fascism by engaging in anti-fascist activities. The wife tells her family they are seeking peaceful sanctuary, but their quest is threatened by a house guest, an opportunistic foreign aristocrat who has been conspiring with a foreign embassy. The aristocrat, married to a younger woman, tries to force her to learn more about the visiting family. She and the wife's brother are attracted to each other, and she finds her husband's politics horrendous. The aristocrat searches the family's room and discovers a gun and money intended to finance underground operations in their home country. Shortly after, they learn that a resistance worker has been arrested. Because this worker once rescued the engineer from secret police, he plans to return to his home country to assist him and others arrested with him. Aware of the danger, the aristocrat demands a large sum of money to keep silent. After considerable bargaining, the engineer kills him, having concluded that the aristocrat cannot be trusted. Realizing the dangers the engineer faces, his mother-in-law and brother-in-law agree to help him return. Time passes, and when the family fails to hear from the engineer, their eldest son announces he plans to search for his father as soon as he turns 18. Although distraught by the possibility of losing her son as well as her husband, the wife resolves to be brave when the time comes for her son to leave."
