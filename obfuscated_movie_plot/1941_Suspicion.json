  "obfuscated_plot": "A handsome, irresponsible playboy meets a bespectacled woman on a train in a European country and later persuades her to take a walk with him. She is defensive and suspects his motives; he insults her in a ploy to create familiarity. But later, at a window, she overhears her parents talking about her. They assume she will never marry, and hurt by this she kisses the man. She hopes to hear from him but he cancels their afternoon date and then vanishes. However, he returns for a hunt ball a week later and charms her into eventually eloping despite the strong disapproval of her wealthy father, a military general. After a lavish honeymoon and returning to an extravagant house, the woman discovers that her husband has no job and no income, habitually lives on borrowed money, and was intending to try to sponge off her father. She talks him into getting a job, and he goes to work for his cousin, an estate agent. Gradually, she learns that her husband has continued to gamble wildly, despite promising to quit, and that to pay a gambling debt, he sold two antique chairs (family heirlooms) that her father had given her as a wedding present. Her husband's good-natured but naive friend tries to reassure her that her husband is a lot of fun and a highly entertaining liar. She repeatedly catches her husband in ever more significant lies, discovering that he was fired weeks before for embezzling from his cousin, who says he will not prosecute if the money is repaid. She writes a letter to her husband that she is leaving him but then tears it up. After this her husband enters the room and shows her a telegram announcing her father's death. Her husband is severely disappointed to discover that she has inherited no money, only her father's portrait. He persuades his friend to finance a hugely speculative land development scheme. She is afraid this is a confidence trick or worse and futilely tries to talk her husband's friend out of it. Her husband overhears and angrily warns his wife to stay out of his affairs but later he calls the whole thing off. When his friend leaves for another country, her husband accompanies him partway. Later, news reaches her that her husband's friend died in that country. Her husband lies to her and an investigating police inspector, saying that he stayed in the capital city. This and other details lead her to suspect he was responsible for his friend's death. She then begins to fear that her husband is plotting to kill her for her life insurance. He has been questioning her friend, a writer of mystery novels, about untraceable poisons. Her husband brings her a glass of milk before bed, but she is too afraid to drink it. Needing to get away for a while, she says she will stay with her mother for a few days. Her husband insists on driving her there. He speeds recklessly in a powerful convertible on a dangerous road beside a cliff. Her door unexpectedly swings open. Her husband reaches over, his intent unclear to the terrified woman. When she shrinks from him, he stops the car. In the subsequent confrontation, her husband asserts that he was actually intending to commit suicide after taking her to her mother's. At this time he states that he has decided that suicide is the coward's way out, and is resolved to face his responsibilities, even to the point of going to prison for the embezzlement. He reveals being in another city at the time of his friend's death, trying to borrow on her life insurance policy to repay his cousin. Her suspicions allayed, she asks him to go home and see it all through together. Her husband initially refuses but eventually they turn the car around and drive away together."
