  "obfuscated_plot": "An aging movie star arrives in a foreign Asian metropolis to film commercial advertisements for a whisky brand. He stays at a luxurious hotel and feels miserable due to problems in his long-standing marriage and midlife crisis. A young philosophy graduate, accompanying her photographer husband, is also staying at the hotel and feeling similarly disenchanted about her marriage and future. They both struggle with jet lag and cultural unfamiliarity, spending time in the hotel and exploring the local environment.\n\nThe two frequently encounter each other and gradually develop a connection. During an evening out, they explore the city's nightlife together, singing at a karaoke venue and bonding over their shared sense of displacement. As days pass, their friendship deepens through intimate conversations about personal uncertainties and marital challenges.\n\nTension emerges when the movie star spends a night with a hotel bar singer, which the young woman discovers, causing temporary strain in their relationship. They reconcile before his departure, sharing a poignant moment of mutual understanding and connection.\n\nOn the morning of his departure, they exchange somewhat unsatisfactory goodbyes. However, during his taxi ride to the airport, he spots her on a crowded street, stops the car, approaches her, and shares an embrace. He whispers something in her ear, they share a kiss, and then part ways, leaving their brief but meaningful connection ambiguous and emotionally charged."
