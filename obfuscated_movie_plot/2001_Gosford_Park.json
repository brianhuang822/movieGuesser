Among the guests are the wife's sisters, their husbands, an elderly aunt, various social acquaintances, an actor, and an American film producer. A visiting film producer's valet arouses suspicion among the staff with his intrusive behavior. Later that evening, the valet has a tryst with the lady of the house. \n\nThe daughter asks a housemaid to speak to her father about hiring another guest who is blackmailing her over a past affair and pregnancy. The blackmailing guest mistreats his wife, whom he married for her money. During a shooting expedition, the host is grazed by a stray shot. He withdraws financial support from a business associate, leaving him ruined.\n\nDuring dinner, the host's wife berates him, and a housemaid inadvertently exposes their affair. After dinner, the host retires to his study. Later that evening, an unidentified person wearing muddy galoshes enters the library and stabs the seemingly sleeping host.\n\nWhen the body is discovered, local law enforcement investigates. It is revealed that the host was actually poisoned before being stabbed. The head cook shares stories about the host's history of sexually exploiting female factory workers.\n\nA young housemaid discovers that the valet is actually the host's illegitimate son, abandoned as a child. The valet reveals he is the product of the host's abuse of a factory worker who died shortly after his birth. He admits to stabbing his father but did not poison him.\n\nIt is ultimately revealed that the housekeeper, who is the valet's biological mother, had actually poisoned the host to ensure her son would only be guilty of stabbing a corpse. The housekeeper and the head cook, who are sisters, both had children with the host during their time working at his factory. The story concludes with the last guests departing the estate."
