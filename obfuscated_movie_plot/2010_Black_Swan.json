  "obfuscated_plot": "A young ballet dancer lives with her overprotective mother, a former dancer. Her professional dance company is preparing to perform a famous classical ballet about a swan. The artistic director announces auditions for dual roles representing opposing character types: an innocent, fragile character and a sensual, dark character. The dancer auditions and initially struggles, but ultimately receives the lead role.\n\nTensions arise when another dancer arrives who embodies the uninhibited quality the protagonist lacks. The dancer begins experiencing intense hallucinations and mysterious physical injuries. She becomes increasingly paranoid about being replaced, especially after learning another dancer has been designated as her alternate.\n\nDuring preparation for the performance, the dancer goes out with her rival and experiences a drug-induced evening that blurs reality. She becomes increasingly unstable, experiencing vivid hallucinations where she believes she is transforming into her darker performance persona.\n\nOn opening night, despite her mother's concerns, she insists on performing. During the performance, she experiences a series of intense hallucinations. In her dressing room, she believes she fights and kills her rival, though it becomes clear she has actually wounded herself.\n\nShe completes the performance brilliantly, dancing the challenging dual roles with extraordinary intensity. In the final moments, she is severely injured but declares the performance \"perfect\" as she collapses, having completely embodied both the light and dark aspects of her character."
