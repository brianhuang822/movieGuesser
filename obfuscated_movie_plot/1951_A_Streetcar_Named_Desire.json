  "obfuscated_plot": "A middle-aged high school English teacher arrives in a Southern city from a small rural town. She takes public transportation to a historic neighborhood, where her sister and her sister's husband live in a small, dilapidated apartment. The teacher claims to be on leave from her job due to anxiety. Her demure manner is a stark contrast to her brother-in-law's crude behavior, making them mutually wary and antagonistic. Her sister welcomes her as a guest, but the husband patronizes and criticizes her. The teacher reveals that her family's estate was lost to creditors. She was widowed at a young age after her husband's suicide. When the husband suspects she may be hiding an inheritance, she shows him proof of the foreclosure. Looking for further proof, he knocks some of her private papers to the floor. Weeping, she gathers them, saying they are poems from her dead husband; he explains he was only looking out for his family, and then announces that her sister is pregnant. \n\nThe teacher meets the husband's friend, whose courteous manner and sensitivity is in sharp contrast to the husband and his other friends, and the two fall in love. During a poker night, the husband explodes in a drunken rage, striking his wife; the teacher and her sister flee upstairs to a neighbor's apartment. After his anger subsides, the husband remorsefully calls for his wife from the courtyard below. She is drawn downstairs by her attraction to him, and they go to bed together. \n\nThe next morning, the teacher urges her sister to leave her husband, calling him a sub-human animal. As weeks pass into months, tension mounts between the teacher and the husband. The teacher is hopeful about her new love interest, but anxiety and alcoholism have her teetering on mental collapse while anticipating a marriage proposal. Meanwhile, the husband discovers that the teacher had been fired for sleeping with an underage student. He passes this news on to her love interest. Her sister angrily blames her husband for this catastrophic revelation, but their fight is interrupted when she goes into labor. \n\nLater, the love interest arrives and confronts the teacher about the husband's claims. She pleads for forgiveness, but he, hurt and humiliated, ends their relationship. Later that night, while her sister's labor continues, the husband returns from the hospital to sleep. Dressed in a tattered gown, the teacher pretends she is departing on a cruise with an old admirer. The husband admonishes her for lying about her past and mistreating him; the two fight and it is implied that he rapes her. \n\nWeeks later, during another poker game at the apartment, doctors arrive to take the nearly catatonic teacher to a mental hospital. She has told her sister what happened, but her sister cannot bring herself to believe it. On seeing the doctor and nurse, the teacher resists at first, but the doctor talks to her gently and she goes with them willingly, saying that she has \"always depended on the kindness of strangers\". As the teacher is led away, her former love interest tries to attack the husband but is pulled away by the other poker players. Realizing that the teacher had told her the truth, her sister takes her baby upstairs to the neighbors' apartment, determined to leave her husband."
