  "obfuscated_plot": "A history professor at a small regional college and his wife, daughter of the university president, return home drunk from a party. They have invited a young married couple they met at the event for a drink. The guests arrive late at night. As the four drink, the older couple engages in scathing verbal abuse in front of the younger couple, who become increasingly uncomfortable and entangled. The wife angers her husband by talking about their son, who will supposedly celebrate his birthday the next day. This sparks another fight, and the women leave the room.\n\nAlone, the men candidly discuss their marriages. The younger husband admits he married his wife for her family's money, believing she was pregnant. The older husband describes his marriage as a constant negotiation and sees the younger man as a potential threat. He shares a story about a childhood friend who accidentally killed his parents and ended up in a mental institution.\n\nThe evening progresses through a series of increasingly heated and revealing interactions. They visit a roadhouse, where suggestive dancing and psychological manipulation occur. Tensions escalate as deeply personal secrets are revealed and psychological games intensify.\n\nEventually, it becomes clear that the couple's son is entirely fictional. The husband dramatically announces the son's death, breaking their one mutual rule of never discussing this imaginary child. The younger couple leaves at dawn, deeply unsettled by the evening's revelations.\n\nThe older couple remains, acknowledging the complex psychological games they've played, with a mixture of vulnerability and shared understanding."
