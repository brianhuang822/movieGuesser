They spend time together swimming in an abandoned quarry and often clash with the more affluent university students who look down on them for their local working-class background. One friend is passionate about competitive bicycle racing, particularly inspired by European cyclists. After winning a high-end bicycle, he becomes obsessed with cycling culture.\n\nHe develops a crush on a university student and pretends to be a foreign exchange student to impress her. During a romantic gesture involving singing an aria, his friend is beaten up by her boyfriend and his fraternity friends. This leads to tensions between the local working-class group and the university students.\n\nThe university president unexpectedly invites the local community to compete in an annual bicycle race, challenging the usual social dynamics. When a professional European cycling team visits, the passionate cyclist attempts to compete but is deliberately crashed out of the exhibition race, leading to disillusionment and a confession of his deception to the woman he likes.\n\nEncouraged by his friends and inspired by his father's working-class pride, he decides to participate in the race. His father shares a poignant story about contributing to the university's construction while never feeling welcomed. The cyclist, being the most skilled rider, takes on most of the racing duties for his team.\n\nDespite setbacks and injuries, he perseveres. In a dramatic final lap, he overcomes the favored university team's representative and wins the race. His victory brings pride to his father, who begins cycling for his health.
