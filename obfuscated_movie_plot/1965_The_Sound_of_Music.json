  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1938 in a small mountain city at the end of a regional government regime, Sarah is a free-spirited young woman studying to become a nun at a local monastery. However, her youthful enthusiasm and lack of discipline cause some concern. The head nun sends Sarah to the villa of a retired naval officer to be the new governess to his seven children. The officer has been raising his children using strict military discipline following their mother's death; they have scared away several governesses by playing tricks. Although the children misbehave at first, Sarah responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the officer is away in another city, Sarah makes playclothes for the children out of drapes. She takes them around the mountains while teaching them how to sing. When the officer returns to the villa with a wealthy socialite and their mutual friend, they are greeted by Sarah and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake, which ends abruptly when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, the officer attempts to fire Sarah. However, he hears singing from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing. Filled with emotion, the officer joins his children, singing for the first time in years. The officer apologizes to Sarah and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, their friend proposes that he enter them in an upcoming music festival, but the officer disapproves. During a grand party, Sarah and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the officer notices Sarah teaching one child a traditional folk dance, he steps in and partners her in a graceful performance. Confused about her feelings, Sarah blushes and breaks away. The socialite, who noticed the officer's attraction to Sarah, indirectly convinces Sarah that she must return to the monastery. The head nun encourages her to return to the villa to look for her purpose in life. When Sarah returns, she learns about the officer's engagement to the socialite and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. However, the socialite learns that the officer's feelings for Sarah have not changed, so she peacefully calls off the engagement. Sarah marries the officer. While the couple is on their honeymoon, their friend enters the children into the music festival against their father's wishes. Having learned that their country has been annexed by an oppressive regime, the couple return home, where the officer receives a telegram ordering him to report to a naval base to accept a military commission. Strongly opposed to the regime's ideology, the officer tells his family they must leave immediately. That night, the family attempts to flee to a neighboring country, but they are stopped by a group of regime supporters waiting outside the villa. To cover his family's tracks, the officer maintains they are headed to the music festival to perform. The regime leader insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the officer to the naval base. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the family slips away and seeks shelter at the monastery, where the head nun hides them in the cemetery crypt. The regime's men soon arrive and search the monastery, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the pursuers attempt to follow, they discover their cars will not start since two nuns have sabotaged their engines. The next morning—after driving to the border—the family makes its way on foot across the frontier into a neighboring country to safety and freedom."
