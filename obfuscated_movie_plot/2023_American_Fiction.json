  "obfuscated_plot": "A well-read, elite Black writer and professor living in a large coastal city struggles with his literary career and family challenges. His academic novels sell poorly, and his publishers reject his latest manuscript for not being sufficiently representative of his racial identity. After being placed on temporary leave, he attends a literary seminar in his hometown, where he witnesses a bestselling author's interview that relies on racial stereotypes.\n\nDuring this period, his mother, suffering from memory loss, moves into an expensive care facility. His physician sister suddenly dies of a heart attack, and his estranged, divorced brother—a surgeon who is openly gay—returns for the funeral. The writer begins dating a lawyer who lives near his mother's beach house.\n\nFrustrated by the literary landscape, he writes a satirical novel deliberately employing stereotypical narratives about Black experiences. Surprisingly, he receives a massive book advance. With his agent's help, he creates a fictional persona as a fugitive to protect his reputation. A film producer becomes interested in adapting the book.\n\nThe novel becomes unexpectedly successful. The writer serves as a judge for a literary award, where he encounters the bestselling author who originally inspired his satirical work. They debate the authenticity of narratives about marginalized experiences.\n\nThe novel wins the literary award, but the entire sequence is revealed to be a screenplay the writer has crafted about his experiences. A film producer is interested in the screenplay but wants a dramatically different ending. The writer suggests an ending where he is fatally shot by police who believe him to be a wanted criminal, which the producer enthusiastically embraces.\n\nThe story concludes with the writer leaving with his brother, having navigated complex personal and professional challenges while critiquing literary representations of racial identity."
