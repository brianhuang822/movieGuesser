  "obfuscated_plot": "A free African-American man, a professional musician living with his wife and two children in a small city, is lured by two seemingly friendly white men who offer him temporary work. Instead, they drug him and sell him into slavery. Repeatedly proclaiming his freedom, he is violently beaten and abused, then transported to a southern region and sold as a slave.\n\nThe plantation owner who first buys him is relatively kind, recognizing the man's intelligence and musical talent. However, tensions arise with a hostile carpenter who attempts to lynch him, though an overseer intervenes. Due to financial pressures, the first owner sells him to a notoriously cruel plantation master.\n\nThe new owner is brutally abusive to his slaves, particularly targeting a young female slave whom he repeatedly assaults. The man befriends this woman and witnesses her severe mistreatment. During a difficult agricultural season, the slaves are leased to a neighboring plantation where the protagonist is allowed some minor privileges.\n\nHe attempts to secretly send a letter seeking help but is betrayed by a white worker. When the female slave is caught seeking basic hygiene supplies, she is viciously beaten, an act the protagonist is forced to participate in, which deeply traumatizes him.\n\nA compassionate foreign laborer eventually helps him, learning his true identity and agreeing to assist in sending a message. Miraculously, he is recognized by a former acquaintance who helps secure his freedom. He returns home, reuniting with his family, who welcome him after his twelve-year ordeal.\n\nAn epilogue suggests his subsequent unsuccessful legal attempts to prosecute those responsible and his involvement in the abolitionist movement, with his ultimate fate remaining unknown."
