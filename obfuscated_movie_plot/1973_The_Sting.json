  "obfuscated_plot": "In the 1930s, during an economic depression, a small-time grifter and his partners con a large sum of money from an unsuspecting victim in a Midwestern town. The grifter loses his share gambling, while his partner, who decides to retire, tells him to seek out an old friend in a nearby big city to learn \"the big con\". A corrupt local police lieutenant reveals that their victim was connected to a vicious crime boss. The crime boss's men murder the partner, and the grifter flees to the big city.\n\nThe grifter finds his partner's friend, a skilled con man, who is initially reluctant but eventually agrees to help take down the crime boss. They assemble a team and plan an elaborate scam using a fake off-track betting parlor. The crime boss and corrupt policeman track the grifter to the city, threatening to derail the plan.\n\nDuring an elaborate setup aboard a luxury train, the mentor con man cheats the crime boss out of a significant sum in a poker game. The grifter plays a supporting role, posing as the con man's disgruntled employee. They manipulate the crime boss into believing he can take over the con man's operation.\n\nThe crime boss hires an assassin to kill the grifter, but the grifter narrowly escapes multiple attempts. The con men convince the crime boss to place a massive bet on a horse race through an elaborate scheme involving a fake Western Union insider. An undercover law enforcement agent forces the grifter to potentially betray his mentor.\n\nOn the day of the con, a twist reveals that the entire scenario was a multi-layered deception. The supposed law enforcement agents are actually additional con men who help ensure the crime boss loses his money without realizing he's been completely swindled. In the end, the grifter walks away with his mentor, refusing his share of the take."
