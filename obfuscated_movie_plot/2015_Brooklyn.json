  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1950s, in a small town in a coastal region of an island nation, a young woman lives with her mother and older sister. Unable to find full-time employment, she works part-time for a spiteful shop owner. She attends local dances with her friend, but is uninterested in the local young men. Her sister arranges with a local priest for her to immigrate to a large city in another country for a better life. On the trip over, her cabinmate, an experienced traveller, offers advice and support. In the new city, she lives in a boarding house that caters to young immigrant women. She finds a job at a department store, but has difficulty adjusting to her new life and suffers severe homesickness. The priest gets her enrolled in night school bookkeeping classes, as she wants to become an accountant. At an ethnic dance, she meets a plumber from a different cultural background. As their romance blossoms and she progresses in her studies, she gradually feels more at home in her new city. When her sister unexpectedly dies, she tells her boyfriend she must return home to help her mother. He shows her a plot of land and says he and his brothers intend to build five houses on it, selling three and keeping one for their parents and one for them, if she wants. She says she does, but wants to visit her mother, so he asks her to marry him before she goes. She reluctantly agrees, and they secretly marry. While there, they bump into a couple with relatives in her hometown. Once back home, she does not fall into her old life, but rather a new one. She temporarily takes her sister's bookkeeping job which shows a promise of turning permanent. Meanwhile, her friend, unaware of her marriage, sets her up with a well-off bachelor. She extends her stay to attend her friend's wedding, and avoids reading her husband's letters. The bachelor asks her to stay and indicates he would like to propose marriage. She cares for him, but is noncommittal, unsure what future she wants and seemingly distances herself from her city life. The shop owner summons her and issues a veiled threat: through gossip from a couple, she knows the woman is married. Remembering the stifling and restrictive life in her hometown, and fed up with the shop owner's bullying, she states her full married name, establishing who she is and rendering the shop owner powerless over her. She tearfully informs her mother that she is married and is returning to her new city. She leaves the bachelor a farewell letter. On the ocean crossing back, she offers guidance to a young woman making her own first trip. Once home, she reunites with her husband and they embrace."
