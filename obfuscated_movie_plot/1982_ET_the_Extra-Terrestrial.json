  "obfuscated_plot": "A race of small aliens visit a rural area at night to gather botanical specimens from a forest. One of them, intrigued by distant neighborhood lights, separates from the group before government agents arrive and chase the startled creature. The aliens are forced to depart, leaving their lone member behind. While agents search the forest, the creature takes shelter in a shed belonging to a ten-year-old boy's family. Initially scared, the boy eventually leaves a trail of candy to lure the alien back home, where he hides the creature in his room. The boy introduces the alien to his older brother and younger sister, who agree to keep the creature secret from their hardworking single mother. The alien demonstrates extraordinary abilities like telekinesis, healing, and reviving plants. As the boy and creature bond, they begin sharing thoughts and emotions. At school, the boy becomes disoriented because the alien is drinking alcohol at home and watching television. Sensing the alien's desire to return home, the boy builds a communication device using household items. On Halloween, they attempt to contact the alien's home planet. The boy falls asleep and wakes up alone. When the alien is found weak, government agents quarantine the house. The lead agent hopes to help save the alien. The creature appears to die but is revived by the boy's love. The alien's spacecraft arrives, and he says goodbye to the children, promising to always be with the boy. The family and agent watch as the ship departs, leaving a rainbow in the sky."
