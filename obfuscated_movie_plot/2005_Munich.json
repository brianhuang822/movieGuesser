  "obfuscated_plot": "A terrorist attack during a major international sporting event results in the deaths of eleven members of an Olympic team. A government agent of mixed heritage is chosen to lead a secret mission to assassinate eleven individuals involved in the massacre. At the direction of his handler, to provide deniability, the agent resigns from his official role and operates independently. His team includes four volunteers from different backgrounds: a driver, an explosives expert, a former soldier, and a document forger. A mysterious informant provides them with intelligence.\n\nThe team systematically tracks and eliminates their targets across multiple European cities, using various methods like shootings and bombings. Between assassinations, the team members debate the moral implications of their mission and struggle with the potential for collateral damage. The agent briefly visits his wife, who has recently given birth.\n\nDuring one mission, they narrowly escape a dangerous situation by impersonating members of various militant groups. The agent has a philosophical conversation with a member of a rival organization, who is later killed by one of his team members.\n\nAs their mission progresses, the team becomes targets themselves. Team members are gradually killed by independent contractors and rival agents. The original agent and his driver continue the mission, becoming increasingly disillusioned and paranoid.\n\nEventually, the agent relocates to a new country, suffering from post-traumatic stress and feeling conflicted about his actions. He refuses to return to his original government agency and maintains a strained relationship with his former handler.\n\nA final note reveals that most of the targeted individuals were ultimately eliminated, including the primary target who was killed several years after the initial mission."
