  "obfuscated_plot": "Woman A and her adopted sister Woman B are both to be married. However, when Woman B's future mother-in-law discovers that Woman B was a foundling, she declares the wedding must not occur, and Woman B kills herself from shame. Meanwhile, Woman A falls for Man A, a brash cashier at a bank, and eventually marries him and moves with him to his home state in the southern region. Man A has a flour mill in a small city, and at first, the couple has an idyllic life, though after a difficult delivery Man A is told Woman A must have no more children. Several years later, their son dies, and Man A's effort to ease the pain she still endures by trying to get her to adopt a foundling fails. However, the little girl's story touches Woman A's heart, and she starts a day care center for the children of working women. Man A's business fails, and they must auction off all their possessions. The local women take over the day care center, and Man A and Woman A move to a larger city in the same state, where he runs a mill. Woman A starts a home for orphans and children born out of wedlock, and works hard to find them appropriate homes, matching parents to child by interests and inclinations. Man A becomes ill and dies. When a young woman comes to try to donate a large sum of money, Woman A learns the young woman's story, and discovers she is in a similar situation as Woman B. After insisting the girl's fiancé won't care that her parents weren't married, she decides to campaign to have the word \"illegitimate\" removed from the state's birth certificates. After succeeding in her quest, Woman A faces one more trial—the little crippled boy she raised from an infant and nursed back to health, finds a new home at last. She is reluctant to let him go, but as she takes in two new foundlings, brought to her door by a policeman, she at last realizes it is for the best."
