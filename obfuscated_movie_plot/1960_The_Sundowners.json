  "obfuscated_plot": "A sheep drover and his wife and son roam the sparsely populated wilderness, constantly moving and pitching their tent at sundown. The wife and son desire to settle, but the husband has wanderlust and never wants to stay in one place for long. While traveling through the bush, they meet a refined stranger and hire him to help drive a large herd of sheep to a remote town. Along the way, they survive a dangerous wildfire. The local pub owner takes a liking to the stranger, who spends nights with her but has no desire to be tied down. The wife convinces her husband to take a job at a rural station shearing sheep; she serves as the cook, the stranger as a wool roller, and their son as a tar boy. The wife befriends the lonely wife of their employer. When a fellow worker's pregnant wife arrives unexpectedly, she helps her through her first childbirth. The wife is saving the family's earnings for a down payment on a farm they once stayed at briefly. Although the husband agrees to participate in a shearing contest, he initially wants to leave six weeks into the season. His wife persuades him to stay. He loses the contest to an old veteran but wins significant money and a racehorse through gambling. Owning such an animal has been his longstanding dream. They name the horse and enter local races with their son as the jockey. The son and horse win their first race. The wife finally convinces her still-reluctant husband to buy the farm she and their son desire, but he loses all their saved money in a single night of gambling. As an apology, he says he has found a buyer for the horse if it wins the next race, which would help recoup their down payment. Although the horse wins, it is disqualified for interference, and the deal falls through. Nevertheless, the husband's deep remorse heals the rift with his wife, and they resolve to save enough to buy a farm one day."
