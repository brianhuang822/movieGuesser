  "obfuscated_plot": "A widowed mixed-race doctor falls in love with a married-but-separated foreign correspondent in an Asian port city during a period of civil conflict in the late 1940s. Although they find brief happiness together, she is ostracized by the local community. After losing her position at the hospital, she and her adopted daughter go to live with a friend while her lover is on a military assignment during another regional conflict. They write to each other constantly. She receives word that he was killed and she goes to visit their favorite hilltop meeting place. In his last letter, which she receives that same day, he reminds her to be grateful, no matter what happens to him, because they got to experience a profound love that many people never do."
