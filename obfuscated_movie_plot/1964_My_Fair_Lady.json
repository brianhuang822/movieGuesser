  "obfuscated_plot": "In a major city, a scholarly linguist believes a person's accent determines their social prospects. At a bustling marketplace one evening, he listens to a young flower seller with a thick working-class accent and makes notes. The flower seller protests and seeks help from a fellow linguistics expert. The scholar boasts he could transform the woman's speech so dramatically that she could pass as an aristocrat at a high-society event. \n\nThe woman seeks language lessons, and the linguistics expert's colleague offers to fund the experiment. The woman's working-class father learns of her new living situation and attempts to extract money from the scholar. The scholar is impressed by the father's audacious personality and recommends him to a wealthy patron.\n\nThrough intense and demanding lessons, the woman struggles but eventually masters the refined speech pattern. As a test, the scholar takes her to a prestigious racing event where she initially impresses the elite crowd but momentarily lapses into her original dialect. She also meets a young upper-class admirer who becomes infatuated with her.\n\nAt an elegant diplomatic ball, she successfully mingles with aristocrats, even dancing with a foreign royal. A rival linguist attempts to analyze her background but mistakenly declares her a foreign princess. Despite her hard work, all credit goes to the scholar, which deeply frustrates her.\n\nFeeling unappreciated and marginalized, she leaves the scholar, realizing she no longer fits in her previous social circle. Her father has surprisingly been elevated to a comfortable middle-class status. She encounters the scholar's mother and eventually reunites with the scholar, who reluctantly acknowledges her importance in his life. The story concludes with her returning home, and he casually asks for his slippers, suggesting their complicated but ultimately caring relationship."
