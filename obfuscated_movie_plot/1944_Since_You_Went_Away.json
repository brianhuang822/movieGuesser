  "obfuscated_plot": "In early 1940s wartime, a housewife lives in a small Midwestern town near a military base with her two teenage daughters. Her husband has volunteered for military service in a global conflict. After seeing her husband off, the family must adjust to his absence and make wartime sacrifices, including food rationing, planting a garden, and taking in a boarder - a retired, grumpy military officer. \n\nWhen the family travels by train to attempt a final visit with the husband, they encounter many people affected by the war and ultimately fail to see him due to transportation delays. Their wealthy neighbor criticizes their war efforts and engages in selfish behaviors like hoarding food. \n\nThe retired officer has a tense relationship with his grandson, a low-ranking soldier who was dismissed from a prestigious military academy. A family friend, a naval officer, visits and becomes romantically entangled with the situation. The grandson and the older daughter fall in love, becoming engaged but deciding to wait until after the war. \n\nThe grandson is deployed overseas, and the daughter volunteers as a nurses' aide at a local military hospital. The family receives devastating news that the husband is missing in action, and shortly after, they learn the grandson has been killed in battle. \n\nThe mother decides to contribute more directly to the war effort by training as a industrial worker. The naval officer returns and discusses his feelings for the mother, but they agree to remain friends. On a holiday evening, the family receives joyful news that the husband is safe and returning home, ending the story with hope and reunion."
