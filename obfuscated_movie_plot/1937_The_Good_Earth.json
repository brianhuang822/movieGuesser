  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century in a rural region of an Asian country, a young farmer named John marries Sarah, a former slave from the most prominent household in their village. Sarah proves to be an excellent wife, hard working and uncomplaining. John prospers. He buys more land, and Sarah gives birth to two sons and a daughter. Meanwhile, the prominent household begins to decline. All is well until a drought and the resulting famine drive the family to the brink. Sarah gives birth to a second daughter but kills her shortly after birth to spare her from starvation. Desperate, John considers the advice of his pessimistic, worthless uncle to sell his land for food, but Sarah opposes it. Instead, they travel to a distant city in search of work. The family survives by begging and stealing. When a revolutionary gives a speech to try to drum up support for the army approaching despite rain in the north, John and Sarah realize the drought is over. They long to return to their farm, but they have no money for an ox, seed, and food. The city changes hands, and Sarah joins a mob looting a mansion. However, she is knocked down and trampled upon. When she comes to, she finds a bag of jewels overlooked in the confusion. This windfall allows the family to go home and prosper once more. Sarah asks only to keep two pearls for herself. Years pass. John's sons grow up into educated young men, and he has grown so wealthy that he purchases the prominent household. Then, John becomes besotted with Mary, a pretty, young dancer at the local tea house, and makes her his second wife. He begins to find fault with the worn-out Sarah. Desperate to gain affection from Mary, he gives Sarah's pearls to Mary. When John discovers that Mary has seduced his younger son, he orders his son to leave. Then a swarm of locusts threatens the entire village. Using a strategy devised by his elder son, everyone unites to try to save the crops. Just when all seems lost, the wind shifts direction, taking the danger away. The near-disaster brings John back to his senses. He reconciles with his younger son. On the latter's wedding day, John returns the pearls to Sarah before she dies, completely exhausted by a hard life. Without disturbing the wedding festivities, John quietly exits the house and regards a flowering peach tree planted by Sarah on their marriage day. Reverently he murmurs, \"Sarah, you are the earth.\""
