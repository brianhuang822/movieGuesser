  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-19th century in a large city, a shy, plain young woman lives with her wealthy father, a respected doctor, in a prestigious neighborhood. Her beautiful mother died during childbirth, and the daughter's awkwardness constantly reminds her father of his lost wife. Her widowed aunt, visiting from out of town, helps the daughter improve her social skills. At a ball, she meets a handsome, charming young man who has squandered a small inheritance on travels abroad. Encouraged by her aunt, he artfully pursues the woman, knowing she will inherit a substantial annual income. Initially overwhelmed, she quickly falls in love, starved for affection. The suspicious father investigates the suitor's background through his sister, confirming his belief that the man is a fortune hunter. Before proposing, the suitor improperly makes the woman pledge herself to him. The father rejects him and takes his daughter on an extended European trip to separate them. The woman informs her suitor of her existing inheritance and her desire to marry him. While they are away, the suitor frequently visits their home, enjoying the aunt's hospitality. Disappointed by his daughter's devotion, the father returns early and threatens to disinherit her if she marries the man. Believing the suitor loves her to compensate for her father's coldness, she begs him to elope immediately. He reluctantly agrees and leaves to pack, but never returns. She discovers he abandoned her upon learning her father would not provide additional inheritance. When the father reveals he is dying, she bitterly informs him of the abandonment. Years later, wealthy and independent, she still lives in the same house with her aunt. When the suitor returns, now destitute, hoping to reconcile, she cunningly allows him to believe they will elope, only to bolt her door and leave him outside, finally taking control of her own destiny."
