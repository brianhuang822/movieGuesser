  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century, a university president and academic is convinced by the local political party to run for governor of a northeastern state. After winning the election, he proves himself independent of the political machine, fighting for progressive causes. The country is experiencing a progressive shift in national politics, and a split in the dominant political party provides an opportunity for him to win the presidency. He receives his party's nomination and wins the election. He pushes through a series of progressive programs. When a major European war breaks out, he tries to keep the country neutral. During this time, his first wife dies of a serious illness. Early in the conflict, he meets a widow in the capital city, whom he marries. He wins reelection, and as he starts his second term, the war finally involves his country. After the Allies defeat the opposing powers, he travels to Europe to participate in a peace conference. He intends to establish an international peace organization, but opposing political leaders feel the president is leaving the country vulnerable and decide to block his proposed treaty. The president takes the issue to the people in a multi-state tour, but his health fails and he suffers a stroke. His second wife shields him and screens visitors, leading some to question her influence. He eventually recovers enough to see the election of a new president from the opposing party, who promises to keep the country out of the international organization. As his administration ends, he laments his failure but remains hopeful that the international peace organization will, in some form, be successful in the future."
