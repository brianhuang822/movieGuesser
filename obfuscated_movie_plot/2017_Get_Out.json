  "obfuscated_plot": "A black man walks alone on a suburban street at night, talking on the phone. A car pulls up, and a helmeted person tackles and kidnaps him. A black photographer travels with his white girlfriend to meet her family for a weekend getaway. After hitting a deer, they arrive at her parents' home, where he meets her neurosurgeon father and psychiatrist mother. The family's black servants behave strangely. The mother hypnotizes the photographer using a spoon-stirring sound, trapping his consciousness in a dark mental void while curing his smoking addiction. \n\nDuring a gathering of wealthy white guests, the photographer feels increasingly uncomfortable. He meets a blind art dealer and another black man who acts unnaturally. When photographed, the other black man becomes hysterical and is quickly removed. A silent auction seems to involve a photo of the photographer. \n\nHis friend, a security officer, discovers the other black man is a missing person. The photographer finds photos revealing his girlfriend has dated multiple black men before him. When he tries to leave, the family prevents his escape and hypnotizes him again. \n\nHe awakens strapped in a basement, learning through a video that the wealthy family transplants their friends' brains into black people's bodies, trapping the original consciousness. The blind art dealer wants the photographer's eyesight. \n\nBreaking free from hypnosis, the photographer fights back, killing family members in self-defense. During his escape, he accidentally hits one of the servants but tries to save her out of guilt. Another servant, controlled by the grandfather's brain, arrives and shoots the girlfriend before killing himself. \n\nThe photographer nearly strangles his girlfriend but stops. When a police car arrives, he surrenders, only to discover it's his friend's vehicle. His friend rescues him, leaving the wounded girlfriend behind."
