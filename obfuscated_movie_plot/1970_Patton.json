  "obfuscated_plot": "During a major world conflict, in its first combat encounter with an opposing military force, a military corps is defeated by an enemy field marshal. A bold general assumes command of the corps and institutes a harsh regime of discipline, while complaining a senior allied field commander is monopolising the allied effort to suit his own needs. The general's command redeems itself in a subsequent battle. Following allied victory in a regional campaign, the general and the other commander offer competing plans for an invasion. The general suggests strategic landings at key locations, but a senior commander opts for a more cautious approach. \n\nThe allied forces advance, with the general pushing his subordinates to make risky maneuvers. During a visit to a field hospital, the general has a controversial incident with a distressed soldier. He enters a key city as a conquering hero but is forced to publicly apologize for his actions. Despite this, he is sidelined and placed in a strategic decoy position, with military leadership confident this will mislead the enemy.\n\nAt a public gathering, the general makes a controversial remark about post-war global influence, which is viewed as politically sensitive. Despite his protests, the situation escalates, and his future is left to senior leadership to decide. Later, he is given command of an army and sweeps across a war-torn region, but is temporarily halted due to supply allocations to another operation.\n\nDuring a critical battle, the general devises a plan to rescue a trapped division, successfully breaking through enemy defenses. After the conflict ends, his outspokenness causes political trouble when he makes inflammatory comparisons. Though relieved of direct command, he is kept on for post-war responsibilities. The general is later seen walking his dog, narrowly avoiding a potential fatal accident, which foreshadows his eventual death."
