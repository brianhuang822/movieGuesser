He hires two criminals to abduct her, promising them a share of the ransom money he plans to extort from his wealthy father-in-law. The plan quickly spirals out of control when the kidnappers murder a state trooper and two innocent bystanders during a traffic stop.\n\nA pregnant local police chief begins investigating the murders, methodically tracing the connections between the criminals and the car dealership. Meanwhile, the executive attempts to manage the increasingly complex and violent situation, lying to both the police and his father-in-law about the kidnapping.\n\nDuring a ransom exchange, the father-in-law is murdered by one of the kidnappers. The criminals then argue and turn on each other, with one killing the other in a brutal confrontation at a remote cabin. The surviving kidnapper is eventually caught by the police chief, who tracks him down after discovering the gruesome crime scene.\n\nThe executive is subsequently arrested at a motel, his elaborate scheme completely unraveled. The film concludes with the police chief returning home to her supportive husband, who is excited about a minor professional achievement, creating a stark contrast to the violent events that have just unfolded."
