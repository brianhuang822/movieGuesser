  "obfuscated_plot": "A skilled dream infiltration expert and his team perform corporate espionage using experimental technology that allows them to enter people's subconscious minds. A wealthy businessman offers the expert an impossible job: implant an idea into a rival's son's mind in exchange for clearing the expert's criminal status and allowing him to return home to his children. The expert assembles a specialized team including a forger, a chemist, and a young architect who designs dream landscapes.\n\nAfter the target's father dies, the team sedates the son during a flight and creates a complex, multi-layered dream scenario with different time dilations. Each dream layer requires precise synchronization to ensure everyone can safely wake up. The team must navigate increasingly complex dream environments while avoiding the target's trained subconscious defenses.\n\nThe expert is haunted by his past, specifically the tragic suicide of his wife, who became convinced reality was a dream after they spent decades together in a subconscious limbo. Her psychological projection continues to sabotage his missions, creating significant risk for the team.\n\nDuring the mission, team members must improvise complex plans when their original strategy is disrupted, including creating alternative dream scenarios and synchronized \"kicks\" to awaken everyone simultaneously. They ultimately succeed in planting the desired idea in the target's mind by staging an emotional revelation from his deceased father.\n\nThe mission concludes with the team returning to reality, the businessman fulfilling his promise, and the expert reuniting with his children. In the final moment, he chooses not to verify whether he is truly in reality, instead embracing his reunion."
