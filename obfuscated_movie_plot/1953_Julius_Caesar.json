  "obfuscated_plot": "An ancient historical drama set in a historical Mediterranean city during a time of political upheaval. The narrative closely follows a classic theatrical work about political conspiracy and assassination, maintaining most of the original dramatic text. The only notable deviation from the source material is replacing a spoken description of a significant military conflict with a visual representation of the battle, providing a more dynamic storytelling approach."
