  "obfuscated_plot": "In a small city during a period of political unrest in the early 20th century, a former rebel group member has been expelled from his organization for not killing a government soldier who killed one of their own. He becomes angry when he sees his prostitute girlfriend struggling to earn money for passage to another country. Later, he encounters his friend and former comrade, a fugitive with a bounty on his head, who is secretly visiting his family. The man decides to betray his friend for the reward money, which would fund their escape. The government soldiers find and kill the fugitive during a confrontation. They give the informant his reward money, which he uses to buy alcohol and lie about how he obtained it. At a memorial gathering, he acts suspiciously, and his former associates begin to investigate the betrayal. Despite his attempts to deflect blame, his comrades eventually discover the truth and put him on trial. He confesses to the betrayal and escapes, but is ultimately tracked down and shot in his girlfriend's apartment. Mortally wounded, he seeks forgiveness from the mother of the man he betrayed. She forgives him, believing he did not understand his actions, and he dies peacefully in a church, calling out to his deceased friend."
