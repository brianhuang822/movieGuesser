  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1967, a young white woman returns from a tropical vacation to her parents' home in a large West Coast city with a black widower doctor. The couple became engaged after a 10-day romance. Her parents, a newspaper editor and an art gallery owner, are shocked that their daughter is engaged to a man of a different race. The mother gradually accepts the situation, but the father objects due to the likely challenges the couple will face. Unbeknownst to the daughter, the doctor tells her parents he will withdraw from the engagement unless both parents give their blessing. Complicating matters, he is soon scheduled to travel to a European city for three months with a global health organization. His answer from her parents will determine whether she follows him. She invites his parents to join them for dinner that evening. The doctor has not told his parents his fiancée is white. A local religious leader, the father's friend, arrives and expresses support for the engagement. The mother tells the father she supports their daughter, even if it means confronting him. She fires her bigoted art gallery manager who intrudes on the situation. The doctor's parents arrive and are shocked to discover his fiancée is white. The two mothers agree this was unexpected but support their children. The fathers express disapproval. The religious leader advises the doctor not to withdraw. The couple and their parents discuss generational differences and the nature of love. The doctor challenges the father for his hesitation. Finally, the father reveals his decision, concluding that despite the enormous challenges, the couple must find a way to overcome them, and he will approve the marriage. The families then adjourn to dinner."
