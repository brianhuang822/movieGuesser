  "obfuscated_plot": "A biographical film explores the life of a groundbreaking comedian, shifting between different periods of his career from early success to personal decline. A young, ambitious performer meets and marries an exotic dancer, while struggling to maintain his artistic integrity. Despite pressure to conform to traditional comedy, he becomes known for his provocative and boundary-pushing performances that repeatedly conflict with social norms and legal standards. His comedic style becomes increasingly confrontational, driven by a passionate belief in free speech and social criticism. Constantly battling legal challenges and societal censorship, he develops a complex persona that blends remarkable talent with self-destructive tendencies. Ultimately exhausted by his ongoing conflicts with authority and social institutions, the comedian dies from a drug overdose in the mid-1960s, leaving behind a complicated legacy of artistic rebellion and personal struggle."
