  "obfuscated_plot": "A surgeon at a city hospital finds a disfigured and seemingly-mute man in a traveling freak show. The brutish ringmaster tells lurid stories about the man's origins. Hoping to gain medical recognition, the surgeon pays the ringmaster to bring the man to the hospital for examination. The surgeon presents the man to his colleagues, highlighting his physical abnormalities. The man can only sleep sitting up, as lying down would cause him to suffocate. After a savage beating by the ringmaster, the man is sent back to the hospital. The staff initially treat him with reluctance and fear.\n\nThe surgeon initially diagnoses the man with an intellectual disability, but discovers he is actually intelligent and can speak with difficulty. He helps the man learn basic communication and prove his cognitive abilities to the hospital's leadership. Despite his incurable physical condition, the man is allowed to stay.\n\nThe surgeon gradually introduces the man to society, helping him build a model of a local church and hosting him for tea with his wife. The man becomes fascinated by the theater and receives attention from prominent society figures. However, many guests still treat him with visible disgust.\n\nA corrupt hospital employee begins exploiting the man by selling tickets for people to gawk at him. The original ringmaster returns, kidnapping the man and taking him to another freak show in a foreign country. After escaping, the man experiences harassment and rejection in public, dramatically declaring his humanity when cornered by an angry mob.\n\nReturned to the hospital, the man is clearly dying. He experiences moments of joy, including attending a theater performance and receiving public recognition. In his final moments, he completes his church model and lies down to sleep as he has always dreamed, seeing a vision of his mother as he passes away."
