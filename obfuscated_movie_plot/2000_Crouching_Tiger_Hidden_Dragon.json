The swordsman has a history with a vengeful female martial artist who killed his teacher. During the sword's delivery, a masked young woman, who is the daughter of a powerful government official and is about to be married, steals the sword. \n\nThe warrior and the benefactor's servant investigate the theft, tracing it to the young woman's household, where the vengeful martial artist has been working as her governess for years. After a confrontation, the swordsman arrives and nearly defeats the vengeful martial artist, who reveals a personal vendetta against his former teacher.\n\nThe masked thief, who is revealed to be the young woman, has secretly learned advanced martial arts techniques and helps the vengeful martial artist escape.
