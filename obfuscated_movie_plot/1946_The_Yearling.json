  "obfuscated_plot": "A former soldier and his wife are pioneer farmers in a rural area during the late 19th century. Their pre-teen son is their only surviving child, and he has a warm relationship with his father. The mother is emotionally distant, haunted by previous child losses and afraid to show love. \n\nOne morning, the family discovers a bear has killed some livestock. They hunt the bear, but it escapes after an unsuccessful attempt. The father trades a dog for a new gun. During a hunt, the father is bitten by a snake and uses a doe's liver to treat the wound. The son adopts the doe's orphaned fawn, naming it after a recently deceased friend.\n\nAs months pass, the fawn grows and becomes destructive to the farm. The parents demand the son fence the cornfield and replant crops if he wants to keep the animal. Despite his efforts, the fawn continues to damage the farm. The mother shoots the fawn, only wounding it. Following his father's instructions, the son mercifully kills his beloved pet.\n\nOverwhelmed with grief, the son runs away. After three days, he is found unconscious in a river and returned home by a kind boat captain. The parents and son reconcile, and the mother finally overcomes her fear of losing her child, showing him unprecedented affection and love."
