  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1945, after the war, a father returns to the attic apartment where his family hid for more than 2 years before being arrested by authorities. He is accompanied by Sarah and Mr. Johnson, his employees who shielded the Jewish family and 4 others. When the father searches for the diary kept by his youngest daughter, Margaret, Sarah promptly retrieves it for him. In July 1942, Margaret writes of the restrictions placed on Jews that drove the family into hiding above their business. Sharing the family's hiding place are the Millers and their teenage son, David. Johnson and Sarah have conspired with the father to prepare the hideaway. Those hiding are warned to maintain strict silence during daylight while workers are present. Johnson delivers food and a box for Margaret, compiled by her father, containing her beloved movie star photos and a blank diary. As months pass, Margaret teases David, whose only attachment is to his cat. The father teaches Margaret and her sister, Elizabeth, while Mrs. Miller passes the time reminiscing of her youth. The strain of confinement causes the Millers to argue and pits Margaret against her mother, Helen. Johnson brings a radio that provides news of the world. Conditions are growing more dire, with Jews suddenly disappearing, shipped to concentration camps. Johnson asks them to take in another person, Sarah's dentist named Robert, who confirms that many of their friends have disappeared. Dreaming of one of her friends in a concentration camp, Margaret wakes up screaming. In October 1942, news comes of Allied military advances, and the bombing of the city intensifies. During a winter holiday, Mr. Miller abruptly announces that David must get rid of the cat, who consumes too much food. Their argument is cut short when they hear a prowler break in the front door; the room falls silent until David crashes into an object while trying to catch the cat. The startled thief grabs a typewriter and flees. A watchman summons police officers, who search the premises, but on hearing the cat voice a sound, they are reassured the noise was caused by a stray cat and leave. In January 1944, Margaret begins to attract David's attention, and Sarah brings the group a luxurious cake. Mr. Miller asks Sarah to sell Mrs. Miller's fur coat so he can buy cigarettes. Johnson warns that one of the employees asked for a raise after implying that something strange is going on in the attic. Robert dourly comments that it is just a matter of time before they are discovered. Blaming the adults for the war that has destroyed all hope, Margaret storms out of the room; David follows to comfort her. Margaret confides her dreams of becoming a writer, and David voices frustration over his inability to join the war effort. Catching Mr. Miller trying to steal bread, Helen denounces him, ordering his family to leave. As Robert and Mrs. Miller quarrel over food, word comes over the radio of the Allied invasion, and Mr. Miller breaks into tears of shame. Heartened by the news, everyone apologizes for their harsh words. Margaret dreams of being back in school by autumn. By July 1944 the invasion bogs down, and Johnson is hospitalized with ulcers. The police have found the stolen typewriter, and Margaret muses that her diary provides a way to live on after death. The Millers resume quarrelling, and David declares he cannot tolerate the situation. Margaret soothes him by reminding him of the goodness of those who have come to their aid. The sirens of an approaching police van interrupt their conversation. Certain of impending arrest, they kiss. As the police break open the bookcase entrance, the father declares they no longer live in fear, but can go forward in hope. In 1945, the father relates to Sarah and Johnson his long journey from the camps. Learning of the deaths of Helen, Elizabeth, the Millers, and Robert, he hoped that Margaret had survived until meeting a woman who confirmed Margaret's death. Opening Margaret's diary, the father reads, \"In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart,\" reflecting upon Margaret's unshakeable optimism."
