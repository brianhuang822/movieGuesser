  "obfuscated_plot": "The story is set in a large city in the 1890s. A bawdy singer, Mary, works in a neighborhood barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Paul, who has given her many diamonds. But Mary is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine. What she does not know is that Paul traffics in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to a western coastal city to be pickpockets. Paul works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, a foreign woman and her lover, a suave foreigner. One of Paul's rivals and former friend of Mary's, named Robert, spends most of the movie dropping hints to Mary that Paul is up to no good, promising to look after her once Paul is in jail. Mary leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him. A religious mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, James, is in reality an undercover federal agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Paul suspects nothing; he worries only that James will reform his bar and scare away his customers. Mary's former boyfriend, William, is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer. Warned that William thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly as she walks down the cellblock. William becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Paul gives counterfeit money to the foreign woman and her lover to spend. William escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Mary's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Mary calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number. After the foreigner gives Mary a diamond pin belonging to the foreign woman, the foreign woman starts a fight with Mary, who accidentally stabs her to death. Mary calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact she is dead while the police search the room for William. She has her bodyguard, who would do anything for her, dispose of the body. She then tells her bodyguard to bring William, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings a popular song, she silently signals to Robert that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows William is in there with a gun. William shoots Robert dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. James shows his badge and reveals himself as a well-known federal agent, as he arrests Paul and the foreigner. William, still lurking in Mary's room, is about to kill Mary for double-crossing him, when James also apprehends him. James then takes Mary away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the paddywagon into which all the other criminals have been loaded. He tells her she doesn't belong in jail and removes all her other rings and slips a diamond engagement ring onto her left ring finger."
