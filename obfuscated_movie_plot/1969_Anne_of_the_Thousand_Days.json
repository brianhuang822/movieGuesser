  "obfuscated_plot": "In a European capital city during the early 16th century, a royal monarch considers whether to sign an execution warrant for his second wife. Nine years earlier, the monarch reveals his dissatisfaction with his current wife and is having a discreet affair with a courtier's daughter. Bored with his current mistress, he becomes captivated by her younger sister at a court ball. The sister is engaged to a noble's son, but the monarch orders his top religious advisor to break the engagement.\n\nThe young woman initially resists the monarch's advances, furious about her broken engagement. She becomes intrigued by the power of the monarch's romantic interest in her. Desperate to have a male heir, the monarch proposes marriage, which she eventually accepts. When his religious advisor fails to secure a divorce from the current wife, the monarch dismisses him and gives his palace to the new love interest.\n\nAfter a secret marriage and pregnancy, the new wife is crowned, but faces public disgust. She gives birth to a daughter, disappointing the monarch who wanted a son. Their relationship cools as he becomes interested in another woman from her household. After a conflict involving a prominent advisor's execution, the wife's subsequent pregnancy results in a stillborn male child.\n\nThe monarch instructs his minister to find a way to remove her. Through torture and manipulation, false accusations of adultery are fabricated. At her trial, she attempts to prove her innocence, but the monarch offers her freedom only if she agrees to annul their marriage and delegitimize their daughter. She refuses, declaring her daughter will someday rule.\n\nIn the present moment, the monarch decides to execute his wife. She is beheaded by a foreign executioner, and the monarch immediately remarries. Their young daughter is left alone in a garden, hearing the cannons that announce her mother's death."
