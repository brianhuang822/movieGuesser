  "obfuscated_plot": "A young soldier goes AWOL from his military unit in 1942 to live among native islanders in the South Pacific. He is found and imprisoned on a troopship by his senior sergeant. Punished, he is assigned as a stretcher bearer for an upcoming military campaign. His company has been brought to a strategic island as reinforcements to secure an important airfield, seize the island from enemy forces, and block their route to a nearby continent. \n\nThe company lands unopposed and marches into the island's interior, encountering local inhabitants and signs of enemy presence. They soon locate a critical enemy position on a strategic hill. The attack begins at dawn, but is immediately repelled by heavy machine-gun fire. During the battle, one sergeant accidentally kills himself with his own grenade while trying to protect his squad.\n\nThe battalion commander orders a frontal assault on an enemy bunker, which the company commander refuses, believing it to be a suicide mission. A private scouts the hill's summit and assesses the enemy position. Frustrated by the resistance, the commander arrives and eventually approves a flanking maneuver.\n\nA small detachment of volunteers, including the initial AWOL soldier, proceeds up the hill. A fierce battle ensues, but the American forces ultimately capture the position. The company is given leave, though they find little respite.\n\nThe company commander is relieved of duty, deemed too compassionate for combat. One soldier receives a devastating letter from his wife seeking divorce. The unit continues patrolling, encountering enemy forces along a river.\n\nDuring a scouting mission, the initial AWOL soldier sacrifices himself to help his comrades escape, drawing enemy fire and being killed while refusing to surrender. His sergeant mourns his death. The company is eventually evacuated from the island, having completed their mission."
