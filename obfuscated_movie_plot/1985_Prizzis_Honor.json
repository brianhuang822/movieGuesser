  "obfuscated_plot": "A hitman for a crime family in a large city works for an elderly crime boss whose business is run by his sons and right-hand man, who is also the hitman's father. At a family wedding, the hitman becomes infatuated with a beautiful woman from outside their ethnic group. He asks his former lover, the boss's estranged daughter, about the woman, unaware she still has feelings for him. The daughter is out of favor with her father for previously leaving another relationship.\n\nThe hitman travels to another state to complete a contract killing for a casino robbery. He discovers the target is married to the woman from the wedding. She partially repays the stolen money, and the hitman naively believes she is uninvolved in the crime. They fall in love and marry in a foreign country. The jealous ex-lover investigates and confirms the wife's betrayal, which somewhat restores her standing with her family.\n\nThe hitman's father reveals his wife is actually a professional assassin like himself. One of the boss's sons wants the hitman eliminated and secretly hires a hitman, unknowingly hiring the hitman's own wife. Another son helps remove the first son from the family after being appalled by his actions.\n\nThe married assassins attempt a kidnapping to benefit the crime family, but the wife kills an important person's spouse, damaging the organization's police relationships. The crime boss demands money from the wife for her unauthorized activities, which she refuses to pay.\n\nEventually, the boss orders the hitman to eliminate his wife. They confront each other at home, simultaneously drawing weapons. The wife is killed, and the hitman returns to his city, mourning her but consoled by his former lover."
