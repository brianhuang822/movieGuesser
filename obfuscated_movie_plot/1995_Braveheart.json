The rebel leader defeats an army sent against him and even invades the occupying kingdom, beheading a high-ranking noble. He also encounters a local nobleman who is a potential claimant to the throne.\n\nThe monarch returns and sends his wife to negotiate, but she becomes sympathetic to the rebel cause. A major battle ensues where local mercenaries switch sides, but nobles bribed by the monarch cause the rebel army's defeat. The rebel leader is eventually betrayed and captured.\n\nDuring his public execution, he refuses to submit and is brutally tortured. Before his death, he shouts a rallying cry for freedom. Years later, the nobleman who initially wavered becomes the kingdom's ruler and leads a successful rebellion, winning a decisive battle and avenging the earlier defeat."
