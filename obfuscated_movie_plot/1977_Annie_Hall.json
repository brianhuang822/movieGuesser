  "obfuscated_plot": "A comedian attempts to understand why his relationship with a woman ended a year earlier. Growing up in a bustling urban neighborhood, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, and was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity, suddenly kissing a classmate at six years old and not understanding why she was not keen to reciprocate. The couple, waiting in a movie theater line to see a critically acclaimed documentary, overhear another man deriding the work of an influential filmmaker and referencing a media theorist. The comedian imagines the theorist himself stepping in at his invitation to criticize the man's comprehension of his work. That night, his partner shows no interest in sex. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whom he devalued because of her interest in him. His second marriage was to a writer who did not share his enthusiasm for sports and was unable to reach orgasm. With this new partner, it is different. The two of them have fun cooking a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. They had met playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk leads her to offer him a ride, and then a glass of wine on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in \"mental subtitles\" as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows her singing audition for a nightclub. After having sex that night, he is \"a wreck\", while she relaxes with a joint. Soon, she admits she loves him, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love. When she moves in with him, things become very tense. Eventually, he finds her arm-in-arm with one of her adult-education professors, and the two begin to argue about whether this is the \"flexibility\" they had discussed. They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, and imagining a cartoon version of himself arguing with a cartoon version of her portrayed as an evil fairy tale character. He attempts a return to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis and an underwhelming sexual encounter that is interrupted when she calls in the middle of the night, urging him to come over immediately to kill a spider in her bathroom. A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together, come what may. However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken and unbridgeable divide. When he accepts an offer to present an award on television, they travel to a distant city with his friend. However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working. After losing her to her record producer, he unsuccessfully tries to rekindle the flame with a marriage proposal. Back in his home city, he stages a play of their relationship, but he changes the ending: now she accepts. The last meeting between them takes place in an upscale neighborhood after they have both moved on to someone new. His voice returns with the summation that though relationships are irrational, crazy, and absurd, we just need to have them. She sings an old, familiar tune."
