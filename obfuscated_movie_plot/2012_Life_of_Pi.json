  "obfuscated_plot": "A writer meets a young man in a coastal city, who tells him a remarkable story of survival. The protagonist is named after a famous swimming location, and in school adopts a mathematical symbol as a nickname to avoid bullying. Raised in a religious household, he explores multiple faith traditions, supported by his mother but challenged by his rationalist father. His family owns a zoo, and he develops a complex relationship with a dangerous wild animal.\n\nWhen he is 16, due to political unrest, his family decides to relocate to another continent, transporting their zoo animals by sea. During a violent storm, the ship sinks, drowning his entire family. He finds himself on a small lifeboat with several wild animals - a wounded plains animal, a primate, and a predatory scavenger. The wild predator kills the other animals, and a large tiger emerges, becoming his unexpected companion.\n\nSurviving at sea, he creates a small secondary raft for safety and begins fishing to sustain himself and the tiger. Despite his moral reservations about violence, he learns to coexist with the dangerous animal. They encounter a mysterious floating island with lush vegetation and small mammals, which transforms into a threatening environment at night, forcing them to flee.\n\nAfter over 200 days at sea, they reach land. The tiger disappears into the wilderness without acknowledging him. When insurance investigators interview him, he offers two versions of his survival story: one involving animals, another involving human survivors. He suggests that the truth is less important than the survival itself, and leaves the listener to choose which narrative they prefer."
