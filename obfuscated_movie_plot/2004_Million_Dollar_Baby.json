  "obfuscated_plot": "A waitress from a rural region enters a rundown boxing gym operated by a cantankerous trainer estranged from his daughter. The trainer initially refuses to train the woman, believing her too old and not suited for boxing. The gym's handyman allows her to train anyway. After the trainer's prize prospect leaves, the woman gets her chance. With the trainer's coaching, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division, quickly gaining a reputation for knockouts. The trainer arranges fights to help her advance, and they develop a close relationship. She eventually earns enough money to buy her struggling mother a house, but her family remains unsupportive. The trainer finally arranges a championship fight against a notorious, aggressive female champion known for dirty fighting. During the match, the woman is severely injured by an illegal punch, leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. The trainer experiences intense grief and guilt, struggling to cope with her condition. When her family visits, they show no genuine concern, only seeking to exploit her financial resources. Devastated and suffering, the woman asks the trainer to help her die. After initial resistance and spiritual counseling, the trainer ultimately honors her request, administering a fatal injection while expressing his deep paternal love for her. He then retires from boxing, and the gym's handyman reaches out to the trainer's estranged daughter to share the truth about her father's character."
