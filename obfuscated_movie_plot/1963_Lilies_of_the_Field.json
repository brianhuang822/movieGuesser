  "obfuscated_plot": "A drifting handyman stops at a remote farm seeking water for his car. He encounters a group of nuns from a formerly communist country—led by a stern Mother Superior—struggling to maintain their modest desert homestead. Though initially resistant, the handyman agrees to repair their roof. The nuns, who speak little of the local language, slowly endear themselves to him. Through interactions with locals, including a café owner and a traveling priest, he learns of the nuns' harrowing escape from an oppressive regime and their impoverished existence. Despite their inability to pay, he begrudgingly prolongs his stay, lured by the challenge of building a chapel for a nearby marginalized community. His initial reluctance gives way to ambition when he confesses his unrealized dream of becoming an architect. Using donated materials and his dwindling savings, he begins constructing the chapel single-handedly, insisting on perfection. Tensions flare with the Mother Superior, who prioritizes pragmatism over his ideals, leading him to abandon the project temporarily. He returns hungover but remorseful, finding renewed purpose as the community gradually rallies to assist. Locals donate supplies and labor, transforming his solitary endeavor into a collective effort, though he initially resists their involvement. As construction progresses, his leadership earns respect, even from a dismissive local contractor who later offers him a job. The chapel's completion culminates in a bittersweet victory: he secretly signs his work, symbolizing pride and humility. On the eve of the dedication, the Mother Superior subtly implores him to stay, but he departs quietly at nightfall. The nuns' echoing rendition of a hymn they learned from him underscores their unspoken gratitude as he drives away."
