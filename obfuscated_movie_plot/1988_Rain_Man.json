After learning of his estranged father's death, he travels to a midwestern city to settle the estate and discovers he has inherited only a few items, with most of the $3 million estate going to an unknown recipient. He learns the money is being directed to a mental health facility, where he meets his previously unknown elder brother, who is an autistic savant with extraordinary mathematical and memory abilities.\n\nThe car dealer takes his brother out of the facility and begins a road trip back to his home city, experiencing challenges due to his brother's strict routines and resistance to travel. During their journey, he learns about his brother's unique capabilities and discovers that his brother had actually saved him from a dangerous situation as a child, but was institutionalized due to a misunderstanding.\n\nFacing financial ruin after losing his car import business, the brothers stop in a famous gambling city and use the brother's exceptional mathematical skills to win money playing card games at a casino. They successfully earn enough to cover the dealer's debts and begin to form a familial bond.\n\nUltimately, the car dealer refuses a financial settlement to give up his brother and expresses a genuine desire to have a relationship with him. Despite his brother's inability to make independent decisions, the car dealer affirms their brotherly connection and promises to maintain contact after his brother returns to the mental health facility."
