  "obfuscated_plot": "A boxer and amateur pilot dies in a plane crash, with his soul retrieved by an overzealous afterlife administrator. His manager has his body cremated, but records show his death was a mistake - he was supposed to live 50 more years. The afterlife supervisor confirms this and explains he must inhabit a new body. After rejecting several options, he enters the body of a wealthy banker who was murdered by his wife and secretary. \n\nIn this new body, he repays investors and helps exonerate a young woman's wrongly accused father. He convinces his manager of his true identity by playing a musical instrument poorly. Using the banker's money, he begins training for a boxing match, but is warned by the afterlife supervisor that his championship path will be different.\n\nHe falls in love with the young woman and warns her about potential future encounters. He is then shot by the banker's secretary. Meanwhile, his manager hires a private investigator to find him. During a police investigation, the boxer manages to mentally guide his manager to hear a championship fight.\n\nHe learns another boxer was shot by gamblers for refusing to throw a fight, and he subsequently takes over that boxer's body, winning the championship. His manager discovers his new identity and helps the police arrest the murderous wife and secretary. The afterlife supervisor reveals this is the boxer's true destiny, healing his wounds and erasing his memory of his previous life.\n\nThe boxer meets the young woman again, with both feeling a sense of familiarity, and they leave together as the afterlife supervisor watches with a knowing smile."
