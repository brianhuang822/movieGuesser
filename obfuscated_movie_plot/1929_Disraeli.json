  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 19th century, a prominent political leader's ambitious foreign policy is voted down by the legislative body after a speech by his great rival. Later, he receives news that a financially struggling ruler of a region is willing to sell controlling shares in a strategic waterway. The purchase would secure control of a distant colony, but the head of the national bank is vehemently opposed to the plan. The political leader summons a leading banker from a minority group.\n\nMeanwhile, a wealthy young nobleman proposes to a noblewoman. Although she loves him, she turns him down due to his lack of ambition. The political leader sees promise in the young man and convinces him to work for him, bringing him into his confidence about the waterway purchase.\n\nA foreign power has assigned two spies to watch the political leader: a well-connected socialite and a government secretary. The political leader has actually hired the secretary to work for him, using him to gather intelligence. When the secretary inquires about the financial backing for the purchase, the young nobleman's reaction confirms the suspicions.\n\nThe political leader sends the young nobleman to negotiate with the struggling ruler. He successfully convinces the ruler to accept the banker's financial offer, proving his worth. However, the banker soon reveals that his financial house has been driven to bankruptcy through sabotage.\n\nThe political leader cleverly allows the female spy to learn of the purchase, and she inadvertently admits to her role in the sabotage. He then forces the reluctant bank leader to provide unlimited credit by threatening to revoke the bank's charter (though he later admits to bluffing).\n\nThe deal is completed, resulting in a significant territorial expansion. The political leader is honored at a royal reception, celebrating his diplomatic success."
