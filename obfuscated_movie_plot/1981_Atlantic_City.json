  "obfuscated_plot": "A young waitress from a rural region is working at a casino, dreaming of becoming a blackjack dealer. Her estranged husband arrives with a large quantity of stolen drugs, accompanied by her pregnant sister. The husband is quickly killed by criminals after stealing the drugs from a mob drop. An aging former low-level criminal who lives in her apartment building becomes involved, agreeing to sell the remaining drugs. He hopes to impress the waitress, with whom he eventually becomes romantically involved. After her husband's criminal past causes her to lose her job, the criminal and the waitress become entangled with the pursuing drug dealers. In a dramatic confrontation, the criminal kills the mobsters, and they flee together in the criminals' car. At a motel, they watch news coverage of the incident, with the criminal delighted that the police sketch does not resemble him. He admits it is his first time killing someone. The next morning, while the criminal is distracted, the waitress takes half the money and prepares to leave. The criminal allows her to escape, even giving her car keys so she can potentially go to another country. He returns to his hometown to be with an aging beauty queen he cares for, and they sell the remaining drugs together, walking away with a newfound mutual respect."
