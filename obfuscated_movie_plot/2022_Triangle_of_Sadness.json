  "obfuscated_plot": "A male model attends an uncomfortable casting call. He is dating a female model and influencer and resents her for expecting him to pay for meals despite her earning more. They bicker about money and gender roles. She admits she is in a relationship with him for social media engagement and seeks to become a trophy wife, but he declares she will come to love him.\n\nThey are invited on a luxury cruise aboard a superyacht for social media promotion. Among the wealthy guests are a wealthy businessman and his wife; an elderly couple who made their fortune manufacturing weapons; a disabled woman capable of speaking only one phrase; and a lonely tech millionaire who flirts with the model's girlfriend.\n\nThe guests luxuriate on the yacht, oblivious to the crew working to meet their every need. The head of staff demands they obey absurd requests. The drunken captain schedules a dinner during a storm, causing guests to become violently ill. Several guests are injured as the storm tosses the ship, sewage floods, and power goes out.\n\nWhen morning arrives, pirates attack, killing the elderly couple and sinking the yacht. A small group of survivors escapes to an island. Initially, the staff continue to serve the guests, but when the toilet manager proves to have survival skills, she takes control by withholding food and coercing the male model into a sexual relationship.\n\nAnother survivor kills a wild donkey for food. The male model's girlfriend grows jealous of the toilet manager. When they hike to the other side of the island, they discover a lift near a luxury resort. The toilet manager prepares to attack the girlfriend with a rock but hesitates. When the girlfriend offers to hire her as an assistant, the scene cuts away, showing the male model running frantically through the jungle."
