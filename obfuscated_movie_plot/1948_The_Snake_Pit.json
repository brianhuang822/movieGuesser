  "obfuscated_plot": "A woman patient at a mental hospital appears schizophrenic and disconnected from reality, unable to recognize her husband. Her treating doctor works with her, and flashbacks reveal their complicated relationship. They initially met when he worked for a publisher who rejected her writing, then reconnected by chance in a cafeteria. Despite a developing romance, she abruptly leaves town without explanation. \n\nThey reunite in another city at a classical music performance, and resume their relationship, though she remains emotionally distant and hesitant about marriage. Eventually, they marry, but her mental state deteriorates. She experiences delusions about time and loses touch with reality, causing tension in their relationship.\n\nThe doctor begins intensive therapy, using electro-shock treatment and other experimental techniques to understand the root of her psychological issues. Multiple flashbacks explore her past, including a previous failed engagement and childhood traumas.\n\nThe mental hospital operates with a hierarchical ward system, where patients are assigned levels based on their mental health and behavior. Initially placed in the best ward, she is eventually demoted to a lower, more restrictive ward after a confrontation with a hostile nurse who is jealous of the doctor's attention.\n\nConfined to a terrible ward where patients are essentially abandoned, the doctor intervenes and returns her to better care. Through continued treatment and therapy, she gradually gains self-understanding and mental clarity. Eventually, she improves enough to leave the hospital, having learned significant insights about herself and navigating the complex institutional environment."
