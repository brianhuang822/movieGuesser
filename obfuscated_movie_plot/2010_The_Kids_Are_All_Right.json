They each have a child conceived through the same sperm donor. Their teenage son wants to find his biological father and asks his older sister to contact the sperm bank. They locate the donor, a restaurant owner, and meet him secretly. Initially excited about connecting with their biological father, the children hesitate to tell their mothers. When the mothers discover the contact, they invite the donor over for dinner. The donor and the housewife begin working together on a garden project, which leads to growing tension in the marriage. An impulsive moment results in an affair between the donor and the housewife. As the family becomes more involved with the donor, the doctor grows increasingly suspicious and uncomfortable. After a confrontation reveals the affair, the household becomes strained. The donor inappropriately suggests the housewife leave her wife and start a new life with him, which she firmly rejects. In a final dramatic encounter, the donor is rejected by the family. The wife seeks forgiveness, and the family ultimately remains united. The story concludes with the family taking their daughter to college, sharing moments of affection and humor, demonstrating their commitment to each other despite the recent challenges."
