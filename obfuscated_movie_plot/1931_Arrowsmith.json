  "obfuscated_plot": "A passionate young medical student introduces himself assertively to a noted bacteriologist. Though the scientist initially deems the student not yet ready to study with him, he is impressed by the young man's determination and honest self-appraisal. When the student graduates, the scientist offers him a research position, but he reluctantly turns it down after falling in love with a nurse. He marries and moves to her rural hometown in a remote agricultural region. Unhappy with his medical practice, he is drawn into veterinary medicine when a client's livestock are dying. Determined to find a cure, he conducts scientific research in his kitchen, eventually developing a successful serum.\n\nReinvigorated, he decides to abandon his practice and join the renowned scientist at a well-funded research institute in a large city. His wife, unable to have children, devotes herself to supporting his career. After two years, he discovers an antibiotic serum and is sent to a tropical region experiencing a virulent disease outbreak. He is teamed with an enthusiastic international health lecturer who is excited about the serum's potential.\n\nHis wife accompanies him, despite his concerns for her safety. The scientist instructs him to conduct a rigorous blind study, but local authorities resist his scientific protocol. A local doctor suggests conducting the experiment in a remote community, and the researcher agrees, asking his wife to stay behind for protection.\n\nDuring the study, he meets a wealthy socialite with whom he develops a subtle romantic connection. His colleague contracts the disease and, before dying, urges him to abandon scientific principles and save as many lives as possible. When he learns his wife has died while he was away, he becomes emotionally devastated and administers the serum to everyone, effectively stopping the disease.\n\nReturning to the city, he is celebrated by his research institute. However, he discovers his mentor has suffered a stroke and is near death. A colleague announces he is leaving the institute to pursue independent research. Turning down public recognition, a promotion, and romantic advances, the researcher commits himself entirely to scientific pursuit, joining his colleague in establishing a small, independent laboratory."
