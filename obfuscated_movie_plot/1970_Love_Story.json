He meets a spirited, working-class student studying classical music at a nearby women's college. They fall in love despite their different backgrounds. His father travels to watch his son play in an important collegiate hockey match, where the son is suspended for fighting and his team loses.\n\nThe young man proposes marriage to his girlfriend, who accepts. They visit his parents, who disapprove of her working-class and ethnic background. His father threatens to cut off financial support if they marry. They wed in a non-traditional ceremony, with her father's blessing but without his own family's support.\n\nShe works as a teacher while he attends law school, struggling financially without his family's help. He graduates with high honors and takes a prestigious job at a top law firm in a major city. They try to start a family but discover she is seriously ill. Despite her terminal diagnosis, they continue their life together.\n\nHe seeks financial help from his estranged father to pay for her medical treatment, which his father provides without fully understanding the reason. From her hospital bed, she makes funeral arrangements and tells her husband not to blame himself for her unfulfilled dreams. Her final wish is to be held closely as she dies.\n\nGrief-stricken, he leaves the hospital and encounters his father, who now knows the true reason for the earlier financial request. He reflects on their love, repeating a phrase she once told him about love and forgiveness, and visits an outdoor ice rink where they shared a meaningful memory."
