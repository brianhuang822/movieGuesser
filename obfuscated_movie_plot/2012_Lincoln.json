  "obfuscated_plot": "In the winter of a pivotal year during a civil war, the national leader expects the conflict to end soon, with the defeat of the rebelling states. He is concerned that his earlier proclamation freeing enslaved people may be discarded by the courts after the war and that the proposed constitutional amendment abolishing slavery will be defeated by the returning slave-holding states. He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand, to foreclose any possibility that freed people might be re-enslaved.\n\nThe ruling political party fears the amendment will be defeated by those who wish to delay its passage; support from party members in the states is not yet assured. The amendment also requires the support of several opposition party lawmakers to pass. With many opposition lawmakers being lame ducks after losing recent elections, some advisors believe the leader should wait for a new party-heavy legislature.\n\nThe leader's hopes rely upon an influential party founder whose connections could win over conservative faction members. With two sons serving in the military, this founder wants to end hostilities before the spring thaw. In return for support, he insists on engaging the rebelling government in peace negotiations. However, the leader knows that significant amendment support comes from radical party members who find negotiated peace unacceptable.\n\nWorking with his top diplomat, the leader seeks to secure opposition votes for the amendment. He suggests focusing on lame-duck lawmakers who will feel freer to vote and soon need employment. While avoiding direct monetary bribes, they authorize job offers in exchange for support.\n\nThe leader's son returns from law school, wanting to enlist in the military. His wife fears their son will be killed and pressures her husband to pass the amendment and end the war. During a critical legislative debate, a racial-equality advocate agrees to moderate his position, arguing the amendment represents only legal equality.\n\nConfederate envoys are ready to meet, but the leader instructs they be kept away as the amendment approaches a vote. Despite rumors, the vote proceeds, passing by a narrow margin. When meeting the Confederate representatives, the leader explains that slavery cannot be restored, as the northern states are united in ratification.\n\nAfter key military surrenders, the leader discusses future measures to enfranchise formerly enslaved people. Shortly thereafter, he is assassinated while attending a theater performance. He dies the next morning, with a peaceful expression, having earlier delivered a speech of reconciliation and hope."
