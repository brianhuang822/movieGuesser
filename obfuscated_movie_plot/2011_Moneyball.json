  "obfuscated_plot": "A baseball team in a mid-sized city struggles to field competitive teams due to low revenue and owners who are reluctant to spend money. The general manager develops cheap, young, and talented players, but the team loses in the playoffs to a wealthy, successful team. For the next season, the manager is given a very limited budget. Through free agency, three richer teams poach the team's best players.\n\nThe general manager becomes skeptical about traditional scouting methods after his own disappointing playing career. He meets a young economics graduate who believes baseball teams focus too much on individual players. Intrigued, the manager hires the economist, and together they study an unconventional scouting philosophy.\n\nUnable to afford talented, expensive players, they focus on maximizing the team's on-base percentage and acquire undervalued players with specific skills. The manager fires a head scout who refuses to abandon traditional methods. A poor start to the season prompts media and team criticism. The team manager resists the new strategy, so the general manager forces changes by trading away key players.\n\nThe team's performance gradually improves, ultimately achieving a record-breaking winning streak. During a crucial game, an unlikely player hits a game-winning home run. Despite becoming divisional champions, the team loses in the playoffs. A wealthy team owner offers the general manager a massive contract to implement his strategy elsewhere.\n\nThe general manager ultimately declines the offer, inspired by a video showcasing the potential of overlooked players. A subplot explores his relationship with his daughter, an aspiring musician. The epilogue reveals that the team's innovative approach eventually influences how other teams approach player selection and strategy."
