  "obfuscated_plot": "A misanthropic best-selling romance novelist living in a large city suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. He uses soap bars only once to wash his hands, paper towels to touch public restroom faucets and door handles, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, has rituals with switches and locks, sticks to rigid routines, and always eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant while bringing his own plastic flatware. A waitress is the only server at the restaurant who tolerates his rude and compulsive behavior. The novelist's apartment neighbor, a gay artist, starts working with a new model. The model uses the opportunity to case the artist's apartment and give entry to his friends, who assault and nearly kill the artist during the robbery. The artist's agent intimidates the novelist into caring for the artist's pet dog, a small breed, while the artist is hospitalized. Although the novelist initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, he becomes emotionally attached to it. When the artist is released from the hospital, the novelist tolerates a neighborly relationship with him so he can continue to see the dog. The novelist's compulsive need for routine and aversion to change is aggravated when the waitress decides to work closer to home in another borough to be more accessible for her acutely asthmatic son. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, the novelist arranges to pay for the son's considerable medical expenses for at-home care if the waitress returns to the restaurant. While the waitress is overwhelmed by the novelist's generosity, thanking him profusely, she is suspicious of his motives, declaring emphatically that she will never have sex with him. A humiliated novelist admonishes her that she, not he, has made the situation personal. Meanwhile, the artist's injuries, lack of medical insurance, and high medical bills cause him to go bankrupt and fall into depression. The agent persuades him to go to another city to ask his estranged parents for money. Bullied by the agent, the novelist reluctantly agrees to take a recuperating artist to the other city. The agent lends the novelist his convertible for the trip. Irrationally fearing the artist may make a pass at him, the novelist invites the waitress along on the trip, reminding her that she owes him a favor, so she reluctantly accepts. Relationships develop among the three on the trip as the artist discusses the root of his estrangement with his parents, who cannot accept his homosexuality; the waitress commiserates; and the novelist's acerbic remarks gradually become more sympathetic. Once in the other city, the waitress persuades the novelist to take her out for dinner. His conversation during the dinner initially flatters herâ€”he tells her that her no-sex oath made him start taking medication to become a better man. When the waitress presses the novelist to admit that he invited her on the trip because he has feelings for her, an embarrassed and fumbling novelist again clumsily deflects. He awkwardly responds that he invited her along to maybe have sex with the artist to cure his homosexuality. Upset at the implication that her sexual favors are for sale, the waitress abruptly leaves. Going to the artist's hotel room for consolation, perhaps their emotional intimacy rekindles his creative desire to paint. He sketches the waitress, nearly nude, making her feel her femininity appreciated in a non-sexual way. With confidence inspired by the waitress, the artist briefly reconnects with his mother, without asking her for money, telling her that he will be fine. After returning to the large city, the waitress tells the novelist she does not want him in her life anymore as he disparages her. Since the artist is still broke and his apartment has been sublet, the novelist arranges for him to stay in his spare bedroom. On learning of the novelist's enormous gesture and sign of growth, the waitress regrets her harshness and apologizes to the novelist by phone. The relationship between the novelist and the waitress remains complicated until the artist persuades the insomniac novelist to declare his love for her. At 4 am, the novelist goes to see the waitress, who hesitantly agrees to try establishing a relationship with him. She is encouraged by her mother, who declares that no relationship is perfect. As the novelist opens the door for the waitress at a pastry shop, he realizes that he has stepped on a pavement crack to no apparent unease. They walk into the shop conversing as a couple."
