  "obfuscated_plot": "A war film presented in a nonlinear narrative. During a critical battle in a European conflict, Allied soldiers retreat to a coastal town to be evacuated. A young soldier loses his squadmates and flees through a military perimeter to a crowded beach. He helps another soldier bury a body. After an enemy air attack, they try to board a hospital ship but are turned away. They overhear military commanders discussing evacuation strategies. The ship is sunk by an air raid; the soldier saves another soldier from the wreckage.\n\nA civilian sailor and his son set out on their small boat to assist in the evacuation, accompanied by a teenage helper. In the sea, they rescue a shell-shocked military officer. During a struggle, their young helper suffers a fatal head injury. Meanwhile, three fighter pilots provide air cover for the evacuation, engaging in aerial combat with enemy fighters.\n\nThe soldiers become increasingly desperate. In a damaged boat, tensions rise when one soldier is accused of being a spy. He reveals he is actually from the country being invaded, having assumed a dead soldier's identity to escape. During the evacuation attempt, he drowns.\n\nA pilot continues protecting evacuation ships despite knowing he will not have enough fuel to return. Multiple boats are sunk, but rescue efforts continue. The civilian boat saves several soldiers from the water. The pilot ultimately glides his damaged plane to the beach, shoots down a final enemy aircraft, and calmly awaits capture.\n\nWith hundreds of thousands of soldiers successfully evacuated, the military commanders ensure as many troops as possible are rescued. Survivors board a train and are celebrated by the public, reading an inspirational address from their national leader."
