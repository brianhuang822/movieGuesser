  "obfuscated_plot": "A high school teacher and coach from a southern state is asked by his mother to travel to a large city to help his twin sister's psychiatrist after her latest suicide attempt. The teacher hates the city but reluctantly accepts, wanting to be alone and away from his unsatisfying life. During initial meetings with the psychiatrist, he is hesitant to disclose his family's secrets. Through flashbacks, he shares childhood incidents hoping to understand how to help his sister. His parents were an abusive father and a manipulative, status-hungry mother. The father was a fishing boat operator who, despite success, spent money on unnecessary business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty.\n\nThe teacher is struggling with personal problems but hides behind a cultural coping mechanism of humor. His wife is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. He and the psychiatrist begin to develop feelings for each other. After learning she is married to a famous musician, she introduces him to her son, who is being pressured to become a musician but secretly wants to play sports. The teacher starts coaching the son while continuing therapy sessions to help his sister.\n\nHe discovers his sister has been in a dissociative state with an alternate identity who wrote books to mask her troubled life. After a confrontation and argument, they grow closer. During a painful family reunion, he reveals a traumatic childhood incident where three escaped criminals invaded their home and sexually assaulted him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother killed two attackers, and his mother killed the third. They buried the bodies and never discussed it again.\n\nThe musician-husband forbids his son from pursuing sports and demands he focus on music. The teacher has a romantic weekend with the psychiatrist. His sister recovers from her mental health crisis after processing her repressed childhood trauma. He receives a call from his wife wanting reconciliation. Loving both the psychiatrist and his wife, he chooses to return to his family, expressing a bittersweet sentiment about life's complexities.
