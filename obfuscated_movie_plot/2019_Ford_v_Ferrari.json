  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1960s, a car company vice president proposes to his boss to boost car sales by purchasing a dominant racing team. The racing team's owner uses the offer to secure a deal with another company and insults the first company. This leads the car company to order its racing division to build a car to compete against the racing team at a famous endurance race.\n\nThe company hires a retired race car driver and team owner to lead the project. He enlists his friend, a hot-tempered English racing driver and mechanical engineer. They develop a prototype car while the driver provides advice on enhancing performance. At a car launch, the driver gives a harsh critique to a senior executive, who then campaigns against sending the driver to the upcoming race as a public relations liability.\n\nThe team is initially unsuccessful at the race. However, the project continues with the backing of the company's top leadership. During testing, they encounter significant technical challenges, including brake problems. The senior executive takes over the racing division and creates additional obstacles for the driver.\n\nAn agreement is made: if the driver wins a preliminary race, he will compete at the main endurance event. The driver wins the first race, beating expectations. At the main race, he struggles initially but then sets impressive lap records, challenging the rival racing team. Strategic decisions and team politics impact the race's outcome, with the driver ultimately not winning despite his exceptional performance.\n\nTragically, the driver is killed months later during a car test. His friend and team owner later visits the driver's family, connecting with his son and remembering his legacy. The car company goes on to win the famous endurance race multiple times in subsequent years, and the driver is eventually honored posthumously for his contributions to motorsports."
