  "obfuscated_plot": "In a small frontier town, a retiring marshal, recently married to his wife, prepares to leave town and start a new life. However, word arrives that a dangerous criminal whom the marshal previously imprisoned has been released and will arrive by the noon train, seeking revenge. The criminal's gang waits at the station. The wife, a devout pacifist, wants to flee, but the marshal feels obligated to stay and protect the town. She gives him an ultimatum to leave with her on the train, or she'll go alone.\n\nThe marshal seeks help from friends, allies, and townspeople, but finds no support. The local judge flees. His young deputy, resentful about not being recommended as a successor, quits. Attempts to form a posse are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople worry about the town's reputation, while others are friends of the criminal.\n\nVarious potential helpers are ruled out: an old predecessor is too weak, volunteers back out, and a young teenager is turned away. While waiting, the marshal's wife confronts another woman with whom he has a complicated past. This woman challenges the wife's pacifist stance, suggesting she should support her husband.\n\nA brief physical confrontation occurs between the marshal and his former deputy. As the noon hour approaches, the marshal prepares to face the criminal alone. His wife and the other woman leave on a wagon. The criminal arrives, and a intense gunfight ensues. The marshal kills two of the criminal's gang members.\n\nDespite her religious beliefs, the wife ultimately helps by shooting one of the criminals and creating an opportunity for her husband. In a final confrontation, the marshal kills the main criminal after the man uses her as a human shield. The couple reunites, and the marshal dramatically discards his badge, leaving town with his wife."
