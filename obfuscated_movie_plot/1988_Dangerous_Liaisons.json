  "obfuscated_plot": "In a pre-revolutionary European city, a wealthy noblewoman plots revenge against her ex-lover, a nobleman who recently ended their relationship. To soothe her wounded pride and embarrass him, she seeks to arrange the seduction and disgrace of his young virgin fianc√©e, who has only recently been presented to society after spending her formative years in the shelter of a convent. The noblewoman calls on another unprincipled ex-lover to do the deed. He initially declines as he is plotting to seduce a devoutly religious married woman who is a guest of his aunt. Amused and incredulous at his hubris, the noblewoman ups the ante: if he succeeds in seducing the married woman and can furnish written proof, she will sleep with him as well. Never one to refuse a challenge, he accepts. The married woman rebuffs all of his advances. Searching for leverage, he instructs his servant to seduce her maid and gain access to her private correspondence. One of the intercepted letters warns the married woman that he is nefarious and untrustworthy. He resolves to seduce the young virgin as revenge for her mother's accurate denunciation of him. At a cultural event, the young virgin meets a charming and handsome music teacher. They fall in love with coaxing from the noblewoman, who knows that the teacher, as a nobleman of lesser rank, naive, young, and not particularly wealthy, can never qualify as a bona fide suitor. The nobleman gains access to the virgin's bedchamber and sexually assaults her. As she pleads with him to leave, he blackmails her into giving up physical resistance. On the pretext of illness, she remains locked in her chambers. Her concerned mother asks the noblewoman to speak to her; the virgin confides in the noblewoman, naively assuming she has her best interests at heart. The noblewoman advises the virgin to welcome the nobleman's advances. The result is a \"student-teacher\" relationship; by day, the virgin is courted by the music teacher, and each night, she receives a sexual \"lesson\" from the nobleman. The noblewoman begins an affair with the music teacher. After a night with the nobleman, the virgin miscarries her child. Meanwhile, the nobleman has won the married woman's heart, but at a cost: the lifelong bachelor playboy falls in love. In a fit of jealousy, the noblewoman mocks him and refuses to honor their agreement unless he breaks up with the married woman. He abruptly dismisses her with a terse excuse. Overwhelmed with grief and shame, the married woman retreats to a monastery where her health deteriorates rapidly. Despite the breakup, the noblewoman still refuses to honor the agreement and declares \"war\". She informs the music teacher that the nobleman has been sleeping with the virgin. The music teacher challenges the nobleman to a duel, ending with the nobleman voluntarily running into the music teacher's sword. With his dying breath, the nobleman asks the music teacher to communicate his true feelings to the married woman; he also warns him about the noblewoman and gives him her collection of intimate letters as proof. After hearing the message, the married woman dies. Meanwhile, following the nobleman's death, the noblewoman sinks into madness and pain. Later, she attends a show but leaves after being booed by her former friends and sycophants, implying that the entire city has learned the full range of her schemes due to the music teacher's circulation of the letters."
