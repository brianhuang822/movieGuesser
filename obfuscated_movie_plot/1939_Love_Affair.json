  "obfuscated_plot": "A painter and a singer meet on a transatlantic ocean liner in December, both already engaged to other people. They begin to flirt and dine together, but become self-conscious about others watching them. They decide to dine separately and avoid association. During a stop at a small island, the painter visits his grandmother, who bonds with the singer and hopes her grandson will settle down. Before disembarking at a large coastal city, they make an appointment to meet six months later at the top of a famous tall building, giving the painter time to establish himself financially. \n\nThe painter struggles to sell his artwork and takes a job designing advertising billboards, while the singer breaks her engagement and secures a performance contract. On their planned meeting date, the singer is struck by a car and told she might be permanently paralyzed. Not wanting to burden the painter, she does not contact him, letting him believe the worst. \n\nThe painter waits at their meeting spot and, after not finding her, travels to visit his recently deceased grandmother. The singer is hired as a music teacher at a children's orphanage after being overheard singing during her rehabilitation. \n\nSix months later, on Christmas Eve, they accidentally meet at a theater. The singer conceals her disability. On Christmas morning, after children visit her, the painter surprises her at her apartment and learns the truth. She is delighted he has changed, and wants to prove she can change too. He reassures her they will be together regardless of her medical diagnosis."
