  "obfuscated_plot": "A mother of two living in a southwestern city is married to an aspiring motivational speaker and life coach. Their teenage son, a Nietzsche-reading adolescent, has taken a vow of silence until he can become a fighter pilot. The mother's older brother, a gay scholar, is living with the family after a suicide attempt. The father's profane elderly parent is also living with them after being evicted from a retirement home for drug use. Their young daughter is an aspiring beauty pageant contestant coached by the grandfather. When the daughter qualifies for a regional beauty pageant, the entire family decides to support her by driving across the country in an old yellow van. During the road trip, the family experiences numerous mechanical and personal challenges. The grandfather dies from a drug overdose, which the family secretly transports in the van to avoid disrupting the daughter's pageant plans. The son discovers he is colorblind, crushing his pilot dreams and causing an emotional outburst. At the pageant, they realize the daughter is vastly different from the other polished contestants. Despite this, they support her unconventional performanceâ€”a provocative dance routine taught by the deceased grandfather. When the audience is shocked, the family joins her on stage in solidarity. They are eventually ejected from the venue but leave triumphant, having supported each other through a transformative journey."
