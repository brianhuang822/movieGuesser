He has a complex history of struggle and survival, having left home at a young age after confronting an abusive father. Though once a talented athlete, he was prevented from professional sports due to racial discrimination.

His older son from a previous relationship frequently asks to borrow money, while his teenage son struggles with his father's strict control over his athletic ambitions.

When his wife discovers this, their marriage becomes deeply fractured. He argues with and physically confronts his wife, which leads to conflict with his son. Eventually, he forcefully ejects his son from the home after a violent confrontation.\n\nYears later, the protagonist dies of a heart attack.
