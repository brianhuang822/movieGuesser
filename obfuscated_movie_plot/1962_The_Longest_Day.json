  "obfuscated_plot": "A docudrama-style film opens in the days leading up to a major military invasion, depicting events on both sides of a strategic waterway. There is disagreement within the enemy's high command as to where the attacking forces will land and how to respond, but the threat is not perceived to be imminent, given the stormy weather. On the eve of the invasion, the military commander, unwilling to keep his forces waiting any longer, makes the decision to proceed with plans to invade a coastal region after receiving a somewhat hopeful weather report. In the early hours of the invasion day, airborne troops are sent in to take key locations, and local resistance fighters react to the news that the invasion has started. Allied troops arrive in gliders to secure a critical bridge, paratroopers land scattered around a small town to defend a vital road, and resistance agents conduct infiltration and sabotage work. There is uncertainty among enemy commanders about whether these events are a feint to distract from potential crossings at another location where senior staff had always assumed the invasion would begin. As day breaks, attacking forces land on several beaches and attempt to push inland, having particular trouble at one heavily defended beach. Two enemy fighter pilots strafe the beaches before flying away. A special ranger unit conducts an assault on artillery positions, only to discover the guns have been moved. Resistance forces destroy an enemy stronghold in a nearby town. After breaking through a concrete barrier, the troops on the difficult beach are able to begin their advance and join the rest of the attacking forces on the march to retake the territory and, eventually, defeat the enemy."
