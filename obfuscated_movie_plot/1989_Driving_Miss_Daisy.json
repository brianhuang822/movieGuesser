  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 1940s, an elderly, wealthy, widowed retired schoolteacher lives alone in a Southern city, except for a housekeeper who comes in daily. When she accidentally drives her car into her neighbor's yard, her middle-aged son buys her a new car and hires a retired black chauffeur since she can no longer drive safely. At first, she refuses to let anyone drive her, but the chauffeur's patience pays off, and she reluctantly accepts her first trips. She initially tries to get her son to fire the chauffeur after suspecting him of stealing, but the chauffeur explains he replaced a can of food he had eaten.\n\nAs they spend time together, she comes to appreciate the chauffeur's skills. She teaches him to read using her teaching experience. After her housekeeper dies, she decides to care for her own house and have the chauffeur cook and drive. The chauffeur buys the cars he drives and negotiates a higher salary.\n\nThe story explores racial and religious prejudice in the Southern United States. After her place of worship is bombed, she realizes she is also a victim of discrimination. She attends a dinner featuring a prominent civil rights leader's speech. Her son declines to attend, suggesting she invite the chauffeur. She hesitantly does so, and the chauffeur points out she should have asked him directly.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the elderly woman begins showing signs of dementia. Her son arranges for her to enter a retirement home. The chauffeur, now elderly and losing his eyesight, retires. Her son drives the chauffeur to visit her in the retirement home, where they reconnect, and the chauffeur gently feeds her a slice of pie."
