During a household mishap involving a toddler's bath, the housekeeper prepares breakfast and offers to work in exchange for room and board. The two women and their daughters become like family.\n\nThey open a pancake restaurant together, eventually creating a successful packaged flour business. The housekeeper's light-skinned daughter struggles with racial identity, repeatedly trying to \"pass\" as white and ultimately rejecting her mother. Despite this, the two families remain close.\n\nYears pass, and the women become wealthy. The housekeeper becomes a prominent community supporter, while trying to provide opportunities for her daughter. When the daughter takes a job at a segregated restaurant and completely rejects her mother, the housekeeper becomes heartbroken and dies.\n\nAt the housekeeper's elaborate funeral, the daughter appears, overcome with remorse. The widow and her now-grown daughter comfort the grieving daughter, who eventually returns to college. The widow postpones her own marriage to support her daughter through this emotional period, reflecting on the deep friendship that began years earlier with a simple misunderstanding and a lost bath toy."
