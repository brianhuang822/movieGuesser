  "obfuscated_plot": "During a mid-20th century war, a mobile army surgical hospital in a conflict zone receives two new surgeons who arrive in a stolen vehicle. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but excellent combat medics. The camp's personnel include a bumbling commanding officer, a hyper-competent clerk, a dentist, an incompetent surgeon, and a chaplain. \n\nThe new surgeons irritate a strict military officer and his head nurse lover by broadcasting their intimate encounter over the camp's speaker system and exposing the nurse during a shower. They manipulate events to have the strict officer removed from the camp. \n\nThe dentist, struggling with personal issues, believes he is experiencing a sexual crisis and plans suicide. The surgeons help stage an elaborate farewell event, ultimately resolving his concerns by arranging a night with a beautiful lieutenant who helps restore his confidence.\n\nThe surgeons perform unauthorized medical procedures, including an operation on a local infant, and blackmail their hospital commander using compromising staged photographs when facing potential disciplinary action.\n\nThey become involved in a high-stakes military football game, strategically recruiting a former professional athlete as a player and using various underhanded tactics to win a significant bet. Eventually, the surgeons receive their discharge orders and depart in the same stolen vehicle they arrived in, concluding their chaotic tour of duty."
