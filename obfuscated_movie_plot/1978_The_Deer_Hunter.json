One friend is marrying a woman who was secretly impregnated by another man. The two main friends live together, both interested in the same woman. She accepts one friend's marriage proposal. Before deployment, they go hunting, with one friend demonstrating remarkable shooting skill.\n\nDuring the war, they are captured by enemy forces and imprisoned, forced to play a deadly gambling game involving a loaded weapon. They eventually escape after turning the tables on their captors. While trying to be rescued, one friend is seriously wounded and falls from a helicopter. Another friend carries him to safety.\n\nAfter the war, the wounded friend becomes traumatized and starts participating in dangerous gambling games involving the same deadly weapon. The other friend returns home, learns about his friend's situation, and travels to find him. In a chaotic foreign city, he discovers his friend has become a drug-addicted professional gambler who doesn't recognize him.\n\nIn a final confrontation, the friend enters a gambling game with his traumatized companion. By reminiscing about their past hunting experiences, he triggers a momentary recognition, and his friend ultimately takes his own life. The surviving friends and their community gather to mourn, with a friend singing a patriotic song to lift their spirits."
