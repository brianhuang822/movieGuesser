  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1963 in a rural American state, a rebellious man is incarcerated for statutory rape, with multiple prior assault arrests. He feigns mental illness to be transferred to a mental institution and avoid hard labor. The medical ward is controlled by a cold, passive-aggressive head nurse who maintains order through intimidation. The patients include various individuals with different mental and physical conditions. The head nurse sees the newcomer's rebellious presence as a threat to her authority.\n\nThe newcomer challenges the ward's strict rules, engaging in a battle of wills with the head nurse. He attempts to boost the patients' morale and self-confidence by exposing them to experiences outside their confined world. He discovers that his commitment to the institution could be indefinite and that most patients are voluntarily committed out of fear.\n\nAfter a confrontation with staff, he befriends a seemingly deaf-mute patient who can actually hear and speak. They plan to escape together. The newcomer undergoes medical treatment and becomes more determined to resist the institution's control.\n\nThey organize a secret nighttime party, bringing in outside guests and alcohol. The newcomer arranges an intimate encounter for a shy, stuttering patient with a female guest. During the chaotic night, most patients become intoxicated. The head nurse discovers the unauthorized party and confronts the patients, particularly humiliating the shy patient.\n\nFollowing a series of violent confrontations, the shy patient commits suicide. The newcomer attacks the head nurse, but is subdued by staff. He is later returned to the ward severely brain-damaged. His deaf-mute friend, witnessing his condition, mercifully ends his life and then escapes through a window, symbolically completing the newcomer's earlier attempt to break free from the institution's constraints."
