  "obfuscated_plot": "A young boy grows up in a suburban town in the 1950s, playing with friends and attending local parades. Inspired by a televised presidential inaugural address, he becomes passionate about military service and joins the Marine Corps after high school, despite his father's reservations. He leaves his hometown and girlfriend to attend military training.\n\nDuring his second military tour in a foreign conflict, he participates in a mission where his unit mistakenly kills civilians and abandons a crying infant. He accidentally kills a fellow soldier during the mission and is later critically wounded in combat, becoming permanently paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nAfter returning home, he struggles with disability, depression, and trauma. He turns to alcohol and experiences difficulty readjusting to civilian life. A parade triggers painful memories, preventing him from completing a public speech. He visits his former girlfriend and becomes involved in anti-war protests.\n\nSeeking healing, he travels to a rehabilitation community for wounded veterans in a neighboring country. He encounters personal challenges, including a failed sexual encounter and conflicts with another disabled veteran. He eventually visits the family of the soldier he accidentally killed, seeking forgiveness but finding only spiritual reconciliation.\n\nIn the early 1970s, he becomes an active member of a veterans' anti-war organization. During a national political convention, he publicly denounces the government and war policies, causing a confrontation with supporters and law enforcement. The story concludes with him becoming a recognized public speaker and publishing his personal memoir."
