  "obfuscated_plot": "During a period of economic hardship, a young man and woman meet when he attempts to steal her mother's car. The woman, bored with her waitressing job, is intrigued by the man and decides to become his criminal partner. They start with small-time holdups that are exciting but not profitable, eventually graduating to bank robberies. Their crime spree accelerates when they recruit a naive gas station worker. Their crimes become increasingly violent, with the man shooting a bank manager during a botched getaway. The man's older brother and his wife, a preacher's daughter, join their gang. The two women instantly dislike each other, with growing tension between them. During a confrontation in a Midwestern town, local police arrive, resulting in a deadly shootout. They capture and humiliate a law enforcement officer, leaving him handcuffed on a boat. After stealing another vehicle and briefly taking hostages, the woman wants to visit her family and share their stolen money. During a surprise ambush, the older brother is fatally wounded, and his wife is seriously injured and captured. The remaining trio hide with the gas station worker's father, who disapproves of their influence on his son. The father makes a secret deal with the pursuing lawman to trap the couple. When they stop to help him with a car problem, they are ambushed and killed by a waiting posse."
