  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century, a young woman enrolls at a prestigious nursing school with the ambition of becoming a compassionate caregiver. She shares a room with a classmate who struggles with homesickness. The protagonist mentions her acquaintance with a wealthy athlete, a relationship later confirmed by his secretary. After six months of study, the students pass their first examination and begin practical training at a nearby hospital. Despite the demanding workload, one of the students frequently interferes in others' affairs. When she learns the athlete will visit the city, she inquires if the protagonist plans to meet him. The protagonist meets the athlete at the train station, and they soon develop a genuine romantic relationship. During the course, she faces difficulties balancing her studies with her relationship. After a disagreement over her nursing career, the athlete is involved in a car accident and recuperates at the hospital where she works. She requests a shift change to care for him but ultimately chooses to attend to a terminally ill patient instead. Two weeks before the final exams, her roommate is reprimanded for slow performance and, following a conflict with her boyfriend, attempts suicide with anesthetics. The protagonist, responsible for the anesthesia keys, had temporarily entrusted them to another staff member. The roommate is saved by a skilled surgeon, who, alongside the head nurse, advocates for the protagonist to remain enrolled despite the incident. The school principal permits her to continue and take the final examination. On graduation day, a classmate apologizes for previous behavior. The protagonist's relationship with the athlete ends after he insists she abandon her nursing career upon marriage. She affirms her dedication to nursing, a decision supported by the surgeon."
