  "obfuscated_plot": "During a political revolution, a group of extremists takes over a foreign embassy, capturing most staff but leaving six employees to escape. These six fugitives are secretly sheltered by a diplomatic official in the country. A government intelligence agency seeks a way to extract these personnel, consulting a specialized extraction expert. After being inspired by a science fiction film, the expert devises an elaborate plan to rescue them by creating a fake film production as a cover story.\n\nThe expert collaborates with a Hollywood makeup artist and a film producer to establish a fictitious film company and develop a seemingly legitimate movie project. They create detailed backstories and fake identities for the stranded embassy workers. The extraction specialist enters the country posing as a film producer and meets with the hidden staff, providing them with false Canadian passports.\n\nDuring a risky scouting expedition in a local marketplace, the group nearly gets exposed, but manages to escape suspicion. Despite bureaucratic attempts to cancel the mission, the extraction expert persists and secures last-minute authorization. At the airport, tensions escalate as they attempt to leave, with airport authorities becoming suspicious at the last moment.\n\nThrough careful planning and nerve, the group successfully boards an international flight and escapes. To protect the remaining hostages from potential retaliation, the rescue operation's true origins are kept secret, with credit given to another nation's government. The extraction specialist is later secretly honored for his extraordinary mission, though the full details remain classified for many years."
