  "obfuscated_plot": "A young, idealistic doctor fresh out of medical training is committed to treating miners suffering from tuberculosis in a small industrial village and is apprenticed to an experienced local physician. Initially driven by ambitious scientific goals, he encounters local resistance to his research. After his laboratory and research are destroyed by the miners, he relocates to a large city, where he treats working-class patients in impoverished conditions. There, his professional purpose gradually diminishes when a chance encounter with a medical school colleague leads to his quiet seduction by an unethical medical establishment, focusing on treating wealthy hypochondriacs. His wife attempts to redirect him back to his original humanitarian medical mission. His best friend, who continues working to improve working-class health conditions, tragically dies at the hands of an incompetent, socially ambitious surgeon."
