  "obfuscated_plot": "A linguist professor, while transcribing conversations one evening, is mistaken for a policeman, causing protests from a flower seller and bystanders. He discusses the incident with a fellow language scholar who has traveled from abroad. The professor argues that by teaching the flower seller to speak correctly, she could have a better future and pass as an upper-class woman.\n\nThe next morning, the flower seller arrives seeking speech lessons. The scholar makes a bet to cover expenses if the professor can transform her. She is given a bath by the housekeeper, and her father - a working-class laborer - arrives demanding compensation for his daughter's absence. Amused, the professor offers money, which the father negotiates, explaining he only wants enough for a weekend of drinking.\n\nAfter intensive training, the flower seller is sent to a social gathering hosted by the professor's mother. Though speaking eloquently, she shocks guests with vulgar conversation. A young man becomes fascinated by her. The professor's mother criticizes the men for treating the woman like an experiment.\n\nAt a formal reception, the professor fears his former student might expose the woman's true origins. However, she successfully passes as a foreign aristocrat. Upon returning, the men congratulate themselves, entirely overlooking her efforts and feelings.\n\nHurt by their indifference, she confronts the professor and leaves. Her father unexpectedly inherits wealth, forcing him into respectability and marriage. The professor attempts to persuade her to return home, but she refuses, suggesting she might become an independent speech instructor.\n\nReturning home alone, the professor accidentally plays a recording of her first visit. She arrives, mockingly quoting her former self, creating an ambiguous moment in their relationship."
