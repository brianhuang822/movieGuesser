  "obfuscated_plot": "A heavyweight boxing world champion plans to hold a title bout in a major northeastern city to mark a national holiday. Discovering his scheduled opponent cannot compete, the champion decides to give a local underdog a chance to challenge him. He selects an unknown boxer who works part-time as a debt collector, based on an interesting nickname. The boxer fights in local clubs and agrees to the high-profile championship match for a significant cash prize.\n\nThe boxer undergoes unorthodox training, including using unconventional punching bags, and is coached by a retired fighter who initially showed little interest in him. He simultaneously develops a romantic relationship with a shy woman who works in a pet store. Her protective brother helps them connect and becomes involved in the boxer's preparation, though they have some tension over sponsorship.\n\nThe champion is overconfident and focuses more on promotion than training. The night before the fight, the boxer confesses his doubts but is determined to prove himself by simply surviving the full match. During the fight, he surprisingly knocks down the champion in the first round, shocking everyone.\n\nThe match continues for fifteen brutal rounds, with both fighters sustaining significant injuries. The boxer demonstrates incredible endurance, repeatedly absorbing punches that would defeat other competitors. Despite his heart and determination, he ultimately loses by a split decision. However, he finds personal victory in his performance and in the love of his supportive partner, who rushes to embrace him after the fight."
