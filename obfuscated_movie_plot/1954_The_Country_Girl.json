  "obfuscated_plot": "In a theatre, auditions are being held for a new musical production. A director watches a performance by a fading star and suggests that he be cast in the leading role. This is met with strong opposition from the show's producer. However, the director insists on the down-on-his-luck performer, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife. The performer is actually a demanding alcoholic who is completely dependent on his wife. Initially, he leads the director to believe that his wife is the reason for the decline in his career, resulting in the director mistakenly blaming her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including the performer's requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract, first behind her back and eventually to her face. The real reason the performer's career has faltered is his insecurity. When their young son was hit by a car and died while in the performer's care, he was devastated. The director also believed the wife to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually the performer who is both. Humiliated when he learns the truth, the director realizes that behind his hatred of the wife was a strong attraction to her, and he kisses her. She tells him that it does not mean that anything has changed. The performer's performance is a success on opening night. Afterward, he demands respect from the producer. Previously, the wife had said that if only the performer could stand on his own two feet, she could get away from him. At a party to celebrate the play's opening, the director believes the wife will be free to leave the performer and tells her that he loves her. Later, the performer tells them he has noticed their longing looks, and all three talk. Shortly after, the performer leaves the party. The wife says goodbye to the director, and he tells her he appreciates a woman who is loyal. She kisses him lightly and goes to catch up with the performer."
