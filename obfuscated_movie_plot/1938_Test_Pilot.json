  "obfuscated_plot": "A reckless test pilot is forced to land on a rural farm in his experimental aircraft, where he meets a young woman. They spend the day together and fall in love. Once his best friend and mechanic arrives, the pilot initially ignores her. To spur him, she gets engaged to her sweetheart. He leaves in the morning, but soon comes back for her. They quickly get married. He loses his job when he clashes with the aircraft company owner. He gets a job with another outfit, flying a very experimental aircraft. His wife soon finds out how dangerous her husband's occupation is, but she promises his friend that she will stick by her man. He wins a race, but a replacement pilot dies, leaving a wife and three children behind. He tries to reform his ways and begins by taking a job testing aircraft, even conducting dangerous flights as he wants to give his wife a real home. His friend remains true to him. One day, the friend accompanies him on a test flight of a new bomber. Upon reaching high altitude, the bomber goes into a spin and cargo breaks loose, pinning the friend. Unwilling to bail out without his buddy, the pilot manages to crash land and pulls his badly injured friend out of the wreckage right before it burst into flames, but it is too late for his friend. When he realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up and joins the military aviation service."
