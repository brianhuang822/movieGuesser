  "obfuscated_plot": "A beautiful young woman is in love with her chosen partner and wishes to marry him. Her father, however, has instructed her to marry another suitor he has chosen for her. When she refuses to obey, stating she is in love with her chosen partner, her father invokes an ancient law that states a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or face death. The ruling leader offers her another choiceâ€”to live a life of chastity as a religious devotee. Meanwhile, a group of amateur actors gather to produce a stage play in honor of an upcoming wedding. One actor is over-enthusiastic and suggests himself for multiple roles simultaneously.\n\nIn a nearby forest, the magical rulers of the supernatural realm are having an argument. They are estranged: She refuses to give up a special child to him. Wanting to punish her disobedience, he instructs his mischievous servant to retrieve a magical flower that can make anyone fall in love with the first creature they see upon waking.\n\nThe young woman and her chosen partner have escaped to the forest to elope. Another suitor pursues them, followed by a desperate woman who is in love with him. The magical rulers observe this situation and begin to interfere, using the magical love potion to create romantic chaos. Through a series of magical mishaps, the love potion causes multiple characters to fall in love with the wrong people.\n\nThe magical servant transforms one of the actors into a creature with an animal's head. The female magical ruler falls in love with this transformed actor. Meanwhile, the other characters become entangled in a complex web of misplaced romantic feelings, quarreling and nearly coming to blows.\n\nEventually, the magical rulers resolve their conflict and remove the spell. When everyone awakens, they believe the night's events were just a strange dream. The ruling leader overrules the original marriage arrangement, allowing the young lovers to marry their chosen partners.\n\nAt the wedding celebration, the amateur actors perform their play so poorly that the guests find it hilariously entertaining. After the main celebrations, the magical beings secretly enter and bless the household. The magical servant suggests to the audience that the entire experience might have been nothing more than a dream."
