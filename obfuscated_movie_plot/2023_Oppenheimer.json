  "obfuscated_plot": "In the 1920s, a young doctoral student grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under a stern mentor at a prestigious university in Europe. The student clashes with his mentor, leaving a poisoned apple, but later retrieves it. A visiting scientist advises him to study theoretical physics at another European university. The student completes his PhD and meets fellow scientists. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in his home country, he teaches at multiple academic institutions. He marries a biologist with past political affiliations and has an intermittent affair with a troubled psychiatrist whose death appears to be a suicide.\n\nWhen nuclear fission is discovered in the late 1930s, after another country succeeds in splitting the atom, the scientist realizes it can be weaponized. During a global war, a military colonel recruits him to lead a secret laboratory to develop an atomic weapon. The scientist fears rival nuclear research might yield a weapon for the enemy. He assembles a team of brilliant scientists and collaborates with colleagues at another institution. Some team members calculate that a detonation could destroy the world, but after consulting with another renowned scientist, he concludes the chances are minimal.\n\nAfter the war in Europe ends, some scientists question the weapon's relevance. The scientist believes it would end the ongoing conflict in the Pacific and save lives. A weapons test is successful, and national leaders order atomic bombings of two enemy cities, resulting in the enemy's surrender. Though publicly praised, the scientist is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities.\n\nAs an advisor to a national energy commission, the scientist's stance generates controversy. A competing scientist's alternative weapon design receives renewed interest during rising international tensions. The commission's chairman resents the scientist for his public statements and seeks to diminish his influence. In a private security hearing, the scientist's loyalty is questioned, with his past political associations used against him. Despite his wife's vigorous defense, his security clearance is revoked, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on national nuclear policy.\n\nYears later, during a government confirmation hearing, details emerge about the chairman's personal vendetta. The chairman's nomination is narrowly defeated. Eventually, a national leader presents the scientist with a prestigious scientific award, partially rehabilitating his reputation."
