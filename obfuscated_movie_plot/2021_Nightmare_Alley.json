  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 1930s, a drifter hides a corpse under the floorboards of a dilapidated house before setting it ablaze. That evening, he walks into a traveling carnival and watches a disturbing sideshow. The drifter is offered a temporary job and begins working with the carnival's clairvoyant performer and her alcoholic husband. He starts courting a fellow performer and learns cold reading techniques, while discovering the carnival owner's practice of exploiting troubled alcoholics.\n\nAfter the clairvoyant's husband dies mysteriously, the drifter leaves the carnival with his romantic partner. Two years later, he runs a successful psychic act for wealthy clients in a major city. A psychologist attempts to expose their performance but is outsmarted. The drifter begins a scheme involving a wealthy client wanting to communicate with his deceased son.\n\nHe collaborates with the psychologist, who provides him with confidential information. The drifter successfully cons a wealthy industrialist by leveraging stolen personal details about a tragic past incident involving a young woman. He plans an elaborate deception, convincing his romantic partner to impersonate the dead woman's spirit.\n\nDuring the planned séance, unexpected tragedy occurs when the client's wife murders her husband. The industrialist discovers the deception, leading to a violent confrontation where the drifter kills him. His partner leaves him, and the psychologist betrays him by withholding his earnings.\n\nA flashback reveals the drifter's history of violence, including killing his own father. Months later, now homeless and alcoholic, he unsuccessfully attempts to rejoin the carnival world. Ironically, he is offered a degrading position as a sideshow attraction—the same type of exploited performer he once observed. Recognizing the cyclical nature of his downfall, he accepts the job with a mixture of desperation and dark humor."
