  "obfuscated_plot": "A young American college student traveling abroad decides to smuggle drugs by strapping them to his body. When attempting to board a return flight home, he is discovered by soldiers and arrested. At the police station, an American translator assists him, but he fails in his attempt to negotiate release. After being transferred to a harsh foreign prison, he encounters other Western prisoners who warn him about the dangerous environment.\n\nDuring his trial, he initially receives a four-year sentence, which his family considers somewhat fortunate. However, an appeals process unexpectedly increases his sentence to 30 years, crushing his hope of quick release. The prison conditions become increasingly brutal, with frequent physical and psychological abuse from guards.\n\nMultiple escape attempts fail, and the prisoner experiences severe mental and emotional deterioration. An informant prisoner's actions lead to increased punishment for his fellow inmates. During one particularly traumatic encounter, he kills an informant and is subsequently placed in the prison's mental ward.\n\nHis girlfriend visits and provides him with hidden money and emotional motivation to escape. After a violent confrontation with a brutal guard during an attempted sexual assault, the prisoner kills the guard, steals his uniform, and uses his language skills to bluff his way out of the prison.\n\nSuccessfully escaping, he crosses the border to a neighboring country and eventually returns home, having survived an extraordinarily challenging imprisonment."
