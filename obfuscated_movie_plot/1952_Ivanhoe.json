  "obfuscated_plot": "A medieval royal leader vanishes while returning from a religious military campaign. One of his loyal knights, a nobleman from a local ethnic group, searches for him, finally finding him being held by a foreign ruler for an enormous ransom. The royal leader's treacherous brother, a prince, knows about it but does nothing, enjoying ruling in his absence. Back in the kingdom, the knight, pretending to be a traveling performer, meets two supporters of the prince. When they seek shelter for the night, the knight leads them to his father's home. The father welcomes the knights coldly while the knight secretly meets with his betrothed. \n\nThe knight pleads with his father to help raise the ransom to free the royal leader, but the father refuses to aid any outsiders. Later, the knight and his servant rescue a Jewish merchant from attackers. The merchant's daughter gives the knight her family jewels to purchase equipment for an important tournament. The prince's goal is to demonstrate the futility of resistance to his rule.\n\nDuring the tournament, a mysterious knight in black defeats several opponents. The knight is wounded but ultimately victorious. When captured by enemies, he exchanges himself for his father's freedom. A group of rebel fighters surrounds the enemy castle, and in the ensuing battle, several key antagonists are killed.\n\nA significant ransom is collected, but the Jewish community faces a cruel choice between freeing the royal leader or saving the merchant's daughter, who is falsely accused of witchcraft. The knight challenges this verdict through a trial by combat. In a dramatic duel, the knight defeats his opponent, who confesses deep feelings for the merchant's daughter before dying.\n\nThe royal leader returns and reclaims his throne. The treacherous prince reluctantly submits, and the leader calls on his people to unite, transcending their ethnic divisions and identifying as citizens of their shared homeland."
