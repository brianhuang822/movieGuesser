  "obfuscated_plot": "After a religious leader dies of a heart attack, a council of senior religious officials convenes to elect a successor. The four top candidates are a progressive reformer from North America, a social conservative from Africa, a moderate from a northern country, and a staunch traditionalist from Southern Europe. A senior archbishop tells the council's leader that the previous leader demanded the moderate's resignation, which the moderate denies. The progressive candidate aims to prevent the traditionalist from winning. The council's leader is surprised by the last-minute arrival of a foreign-born archbishop whom the previous leader had quietly promoted. \n\nThe council begins deliberations, with the leader giving an impromptu speech encouraging embracing uncertainty, which some interpret as a declaration of his own ambitions. No candidate initially achieves the required votes, with the African candidate leading, while the progressive candidates split their support. An assistant discovers suspicious travel arrangements for the foreign-born archbishop.\n\nOn the second day, a controversy emerges involving the African candidate's past personal relationship, which effectively derails his candidacy. The progressive candidate reluctantly supports the moderate. The council leader, working with a senior nun, discovers the moderate had arranged a suspicious transfer for a specific individual. Documents are found suggesting the moderate paid for votes.\n\nOn the third day, the moderate is removed from contention. The council leader reconciles with the progressive candidate and agrees to stand against the traditionalist. Before voting can conclude, an explosion damages the voting chamber. Concurrent terrorist attacks are happening across a continent. While the traditionalist calls for a harsh religious response, the foreign-born archbishop argues against violence.\n\nVoting resumes, and the foreign-born archbishop is overwhelmingly elected as the new religious leader. The council leader later learns the archbishop was born with unique biological characteristics that were previously unknown to him. The archbishop had chosen to decline medical intervention, believing in accepting his original form.\n\nThe story concludes with the council leader observing young religious workers in a courtyard, listening to the celebrations of the new leader's election."
