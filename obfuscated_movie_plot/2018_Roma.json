  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1970s, a live-in housekeeper works for an upper-middle-class family in a large city. The household includes the parents, their four school-aged children, and the mother's elderly mother. The father, a medical professional, frequently travels, and his wife suspects he is having an affair. The housekeeper discovers she is pregnant and tells her boyfriend, who abandons her after initially appearing supportive. She confides in her employer, who provides emotional support and takes her to the hospital to confirm the pregnancy.\n\nThe family goes to a country estate for New Year celebrations, where a forest fire breaks out that the guests help extinguish. Back in the city, the housekeeper sees the father flirting with a young woman. She searches for her boyfriend in a poor neighborhood, finding him at a military-style training camp. He denies paternity and threatens her if she speaks to him again.\n\nAs the pregnancy progresses, the mother becomes increasingly distressed about her husband's infidelity. While shopping for a baby crib, they are caught in a violent student protest that turns into a deadly massacre. A paramilitary group attacks the protesters, and the housekeeper's ex-boyfriend is among the militants. Her water breaks during the chaos, and she struggles to reach the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, she delivers a stillborn baby girl, with the father briefly appearing and then leaving. Later, the mother takes the housekeeper and children to the beach, revealing her plan to separate from her husband. At the beach, the housekeeper saves two children from drowning, despite not knowing how to swim. The family expresses their love for her, and she admits she did not want her baby to be born. They return home to a reorganized house, and the housekeeper begins doing laundry."
