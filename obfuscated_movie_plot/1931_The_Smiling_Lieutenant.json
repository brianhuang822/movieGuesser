  "obfuscated_plot": "In a central European city, a young military lieutenant meets the leader of an all-female orchestra. They soon fall in love. While standing in formation at a parade honouring the visiting royal family, the lieutenant winks at his lover in the crowd. Unfortunately, the gesture is intercepted by a naive royal princess. The princess takes offence; to appease her, the lieutenant insists that he winked and smiled at her because of her beauty. This backfires; charmed and besotted, the princess demands that she marry the lieutenant, and threatens to marry a foreigner if this plan is thwarted. His original lover leaves him upon seeing him return in a royal carriage. After intervention by the country's monarch, an international incident is narrowly averted by the marriage of the lieutenant and the princess, though the marriage is not consummated, as the lieutenant will only chastely kiss his bride—and his father-in-law. Homesick and lovesick, the lieutenant wanders the streets, and encounters his original lover, who has continued to perform with her orchestra in the royal city since the wedding, unable to move on. The two resume their romance. The princess finds out and confronts the other woman. During the confrontation, she realizes that she is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant. She decides to save the marriage by giving the dowdy princess a makeover, and they sing a duet about updating her undergarments before departing for good. The results are a complete success as the lieutenant returns home, follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing wife into the bedroom and closes the door – opening it briefly to give the audience a last song and suggestive wink."
