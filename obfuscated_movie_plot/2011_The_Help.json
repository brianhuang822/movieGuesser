  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1963, an African-American domestic worker raises her employer's neglected daughter in a Southern city. Her best friend works for another household led by a manipulative socialite who leads a women's social group. A young, unmarried aspiring writer and recent college graduate witnesses systemic racism and the mistreatment of domestic workers. The socialite insists on installing segregated facilities for workers, preventing them from using \"white\" amenities.\n\nThe writer decides to compile interviews with domestic workers to expose their experiences. Her friend is fired and blacklisted after defying her employer during a dangerous storm. Another employer, a pregnant housewife ostracized by local socialites, hires the fired worker secretly. The workers eventually agree to be interviewed after attending a powerful sermon.\n\nThe writer's editor demands more stories, but fear prevents others from participating. Personal tragedies and a local civil rights assassination eventually inspire more workers to share their experiences. As a form of protection, one worker reveals a shocking act of revenge - secretly serving her former employer a pie containing her own excrement.\n\nThe writer's article is published anonymously and becomes widely read. She shares the proceeds with the workers. Her personal relationships suffer, but she gains professional opportunity. The manipulative socialite is ultimately humiliated and unable to retaliate.\n\nThe domestic workers find various forms of empowerment: one gains job security, another is honored by her community. The protagonist decides to leave domestic work and pursue writing, symbolizing her personal liberation."
