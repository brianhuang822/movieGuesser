  "obfuscated_plot": "A young secretary arrives in a European capital city and is greeted by the woman she is replacing at an international distribution agency. They drive to a shared villa with another secretary who works for an expatriate author. On their way into town, they stop at a famous fountain, where they engage in a local tradition of coin-throwing and making wishes about returning to the city.\n\nThe new secretary is introduced to a local translator at the agency, and she notices an attraction between her predecessor and the translator. At a party, she becomes smitten with a charming prince known for his romantic conquests. The predecessor confides that she hopes to find a husband in another country, believing local wealthy men are not interested in secretaries.\n\nThe translator invites the predecessor to his family's farm, and they develop romantic feelings. Meanwhile, the prince invites the new secretary to travel, with her requiring a chaperone. Her boss becomes suspicious of the predecessor's relationship and fires the translator, causing tension between the two women.\n\nThe new secretary strategically learns about the prince's interests and lies about her background to win his affection. She even meets his mother, who initially approves. However, when she reveals her manipulations, he becomes angry and rejects her.\n\nSimultaneously, the other secretary and the author's long-time secretary have their own romantic developments. The author, upon learning he is terminally ill, offers a marriage of convenience that he later rescinds. He then uses psychological tactics to reunite the new secretary with the prince.\n\nThe story concludes at the same fountain where they initially made wishes, with couples reuniting and water symbolically springing back to life, representing hope and renewed connections."
