  "obfuscated_plot": "The story takes place over 24 years, beginning in the present year and then flashing back to the late 1990s onward. An unseen, unnamed couple observe a woman, her husband, and her childhood friend at a city bar and openly speculate on the trio's relationship dynamic. In a city in an Asian country, two 12-year-old classmates develop feelings for each other and go on a playdate set up by their parents. Shortly thereafter, the girl's family immigrates to another country and the two lose contact. The girl changes her name. Her childhood friend has finished his military service and the girl has moved to a large city. While calling her mother, she discovers online that her childhood friend had posted that he was looking for her, unaware of her name change. They reconnect through video calls but are unable to visit each other, as she is about to attend a writer's retreat and he is moving to another country for a language exchange. Eventually, she tells him they should stop talking for a while, as she wants to focus on her writing and life in the city. At her retreat, she meets a man and they fall in love, at one point discussing a philosophical concept about relationships between souls in past and present lives. Her childhood friend also meets a woman, whom he begins to date. The woman and her husband are married and living in the city. Her childhood friend, no longer with his girlfriend, travels to visit her. Her husband wonders if he is a roadblock in their love story, suggesting that if another man with similar appeal had met her at the same time, she would have married him to secure residency. He also expresses anxiety about cultural barriers in their relationship. She reassures her husband that she loves him. The next night, the three go out to a bar. Initially, she translates between the two men, but eventually speaks with her childhood friend exclusively in his native language. He wonders what they were to each other in their past lives, and what would have happened if she had never left her home country and they had continued their relationship. When she goes to the bathroom, her childhood friend apologizes to her husband for speaking alone with her, but her husband says he is glad to have met him. They return to the couple's apartment. Her childhood friend invites them to visit him in his home country and calls a ride-sharing service. She waits with him, and the two exchange long looks at each other until the car arrives. Her childhood friend says that perhaps they are, at that moment, experiencing a past life, and asks her what their relationship will be in their next life. She says she does not know. He says, \"I'll see you then.\" He leaves in the car and she walks back to her apartment, crying into her husband's arms."
