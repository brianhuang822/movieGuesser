  "obfuscated_plot": "Two store models, working in bridal clothes, spend an afternoon together. After work, one woman fends off her boss by claiming to be married to a prizefighter. They visit an amusement park. On a return boat trip, the women make a bet about attracting a man's attention, and one woman deliberately annoys him by playing a ukulele. The man initially reacts grumpily but slowly forms a connection with the woman and sees her home. He works in a radio shop and dreams of owning his own business, for which he has been saving. After forgetting a date, the woman finds him at his boarding house, and they spend the night together. He walks her home, but she fears her abusive elder brother's reaction. The man proposes marriage, which she happily accepts. Her brother calls her a tramp and throws her out. She becomes anxious when he seems to disappear, but he returns having arranged a new living situation, and they marry. Ten weeks later, she discovers she is pregnant but hesitates to tell him, knowing he is about to open his shop. She suggests returning to work, which he opposes. Misunderstanding each other's feelings about the pregnancy, tension grows in their marriage. He secretly works as a boxer to pay for a top doctor, earning money without telling her. During one fight, she goes to the hospital; when he returns bruised, she assumes he was in a bar fight. After their son is born, she plans to leave, but they ultimately clear up their misunderstandings and return home together to raise their child."
