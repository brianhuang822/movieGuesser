  "obfuscated_plot": "A panorama of a historic city in the early 17th century is shown, transitioning to a local theater where an audience is being seated. A narrator enters and asks the audience to use their imagination to visualize the setting. Two religious leaders are seen discussing state affairs on a balcony. The young king enters and discusses the political situation with his nobles. A mocking gift is delivered, which offends the king and prompts him to prepare for a military campaign to claim a neighboring kingdom's throne.\n\nSome comedic supporting characters from previous stories decide to join the king's army. An older mentor figure dies before the campaign begins. The military expedition embarks from a port and lands in the foreign territory, quickly advancing and laying siege to a key city. The king delivers an inspiring speech, and the city falls to his forces.\n\nThe army continues marching and encounters the enemy forces in a significant battle. The night before the battle, the king disguises himself to secretly assess his soldiers' morale. The next morning, he delivers another rousing speech to his troops before the conflict.\n\nDuring the battle, the king's archers devastate the enemy forces. The opposing army, weighed down by heavy armor and stuck in muddy terrain, becomes vulnerable. The enemy commits a war crime by killing the young support staff, which angers the king. He personally confronts and defeats the enemy leader in combat.\n\nThe victory results in the king gaining control of the foreign kingdom through both military conquest and a political marriage to a princess. The story concludes by returning to the theater, with actors taking their final bows."
