  "obfuscated_plot": "In a remote desert region, a local herder purchases a rifle to protect his livestock from predators. He gives the weapon to his two young sons, who decide to test its range by shooting at distant objects. Accidentally, they strike a tourist bus, critically wounding a foreign woman traveling with her husband. The boys hide the rifle and flee, but are eventually confronted by their father and local authorities. A violent confrontation ensues, resulting in one son being seriously injured.\n\nThe wounded woman and her husband are stranded in a rural village, waiting for medical assistance. Eventually, they are transported to a hospital in a large coastal city, where her recovery is expected. Meanwhile, their children's caregiver, facing a family obligation, decides to take the children across the border without proper authorization. During the journey, complications arise when her intoxicated nephew abandons them in a desert area. The caregiver is ultimately arrested, and the children are rescued, though she faces deportation.\n\nIn a parallel storyline, a deaf teenage girl in a large urban center struggles with communication and social interactions. She encounters law enforcement officials investigating a hunting expedition her father took in the same desert region where the shooting occurred. The girl, dealing with significant emotional trauma from her mother's suicide, makes several inappropriate attempts to connect with others.\n\nThe narratives converge through a rifle that connects multiple characters across different countries, revealing how seemingly unrelated events can be intricately linked through chance and circumstance."
