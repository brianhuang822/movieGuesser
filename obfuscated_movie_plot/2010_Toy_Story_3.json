His other toys are mistakenly placed in a garbage bag and nearly discarded, but they escape and voluntarily donate themselves to a daycare center. The lead toy tries to convince them to return home but fails. At the daycare, the toys are welcomed and given a tour by the seemingly friendly toys who run the facility. Most toys choose to stay, except the lead toy who tries to return home.\n\nA young girl finds the lead toy and plays with him at her house. When the original group of toys experiences rough treatment in the toddler room, they attempt to transfer to the older children's room. However, the tyrannical leader of the daycare toys captures and brainwashes one of them, turning him against his friends.\n\nThrough a series of revelations, it's discovered that the daycare leader was once a beloved toy who was abandoned and became bitter. The lead toy returns and helps his friends plan an escape. After a complex breakout attempt, they end up in a garbage truck and are nearly destroyed in an industrial incinerator. Miraculously rescued, they are ultimately donated to the young girl.\n\nThe original owner says goodbye to his childhood toys, carefully introducing each one to their new owner. The toys begin their new life with the little girl, knowing they will be loved and played with again.
