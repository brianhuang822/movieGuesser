  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-1800s, a mute Scottish woman travels to a remote colonial settlement with her daughter for an arranged marriage to a settler. The woman has not spoken since childhood, and she communicates through playing the piano and sign language, with her daughter acting as her interpreter. They are stranded on a beach with their handcrafted piano by a ship's crew. The next day, her husband arrives with local workers and a neighboring sailor who has adapted to indigenous customs. The husband declares they cannot retrieve the piano, claiming sacrifices must be made. Desperate to recover her instrument, the woman seeks the sailor's help. Intrigued by her music, the sailor trades land with her husband in exchange for piano lessons. She reluctantly agrees, trading lessons for piano keys while resisting the sailor's intimate advances. She explores her sensuality with the sailor while continuing to rebuff her husband's advances. The sailor eventually returns the piano, wanting genuine emotional connection. The husband discovers their intimate relationship and becomes enraged. After a confrontation, he violently cuts off her finger when she tries to send a love message to the sailor. The sailor and the woman eventually leave together, and during their journey, she asks him to throw the piano overboard. She attempts suicide by allowing herself to be dragged underwater by the piano but is ultimately saved. In the epilogue, she describes her new life with the sailor, where she is learning to speak and has been given a metal prosthetic finger, occasionally dreaming of the piano resting at the ocean's bottom."
