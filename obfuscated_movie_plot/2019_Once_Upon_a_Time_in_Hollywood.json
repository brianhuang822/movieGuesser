His agent suggests working in foreign films, which the actor considers beneath him. His best friend, a stunt double and personal assistant, is a World War II veteran living in a trailer with his dog. The stunt double struggles to find work due to past rumors and a violent incident. The actor lives near a young actress and her film director husband, hoping a connection might revive his career. \n\nAfter noticing some strange visitors at the neighboring house, the stunt double gives a hitchhiker a ride to an abandoned film ranch. He checks on the nearly blind ranch owner and confronts some aggressive residents. During a TV show filming, the actor has an emotional breakdown but later delivers an impressive performance, boosting his confidence.\n\nThe agent books the actor for foreign film work, and he travels abroad for several months, marrying a local actress. Returning home, they celebrate their friendship with drinks. That evening, a group of cult followers arrives to commit murder. The actor, hearing a disturbance, confronts them, which changes their original target.\n\nThe intruders break into the house, leading to a violent confrontation. The stunt double, aided by his dog, fights off the attackers with brutal efficiency. The actor uses a prop from his acting days as a weapon, ultimately helping defeat the assailants. After the police arrive and the stunt double is treated for injuries, the neighbors invite the actor over for a drink."
