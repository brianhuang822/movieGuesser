  "obfuscated_plot": "A group of soldiers shoot down a military aircraft flying across a desert. A local tribal group pulls the badly burned pilot from the wreckage, rescuing him. A young military nurse discovers her romantic partner has been killed. In mid-20th century wartime, she is caring for a dying, severely burned patient who cannot remember his name. His only possession is an ancient historical text with personal notes and mementos inside. After a colleague is killed, she decides she is a curse to her loved ones and settles in a damaged building with her patient. A military engineer and a intelligence operative join them. The patient gradually reveals his past story. The nurse and the engineer begin a romantic relationship.\n\nIn the late 1930s, a cartographer is exploring a desert region with an archaeological expedition group, including his friend and a married couple who provide aerial surveys. He discovers an ancient cave with historical artwork. The cartographer and the wife of the married couple fall in love. They begin a secret affair, which the husband eventually discovers. The wife ends the relationship, fearing consequences. The archaeological project is halted by the outbreak of war.\n\nAn intelligence operative seeks revenge for past injuries and suspects the cartographer of betraying military information. The cartographer admits to potentially causing the deaths of the married couple. He explains how the husband attempted a murder-suicide after discovering the affair. The cartographer carried the wounded wife to a remote cave, leaving her with supplies, and trekked across the desert seeking help. After being detained and escaping, he eventually finds a military unit and exchanges maps for transportation.\n\nUpon returning to the cave, he finds the wife has died. They are later shot down while attempting to escape. After hearing the full story, the intelligence operative abandons his revenge quest. The engineer is reassigned after completing his work, and he and the nurse part with plans to reunite. The dying patient requests a fatal dose of medication, which the nurse ultimately administers. She reads his lover's final letter as he drifts to sleep, and the next morning departs with the intelligence operative, carrying the patient's book."
