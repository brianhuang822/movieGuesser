  "obfuscated_plot": "A left-wing opposition in a Mediterranean country plans to have a prominent government deputy give a speech advocating for nuclear disarmament, but the government interferes by pressuring venues and harassing attendees. The opposition receives an anonymous tip about a threat to the deputy's life, which government officials dismiss.\n\nDuring the speech, another deputy goes to find promised protection but is mistaken for the target and savagely beaten. As the intended target crosses the street after his speech, a delivery truck speeds past, and a man strikes him down with a club. The Chief Prosecutor is informed, and the head of state police lies that the deputy was injured by a drunk driver in custody. A phone call reveals the deputy has died.\n\nAt the hospital, a magistrate investigates and learns the autopsy indicates death by blows to the head. A witness is nearly silenced by another attack, but testifies that the driver talked openly about the murder plan. A journalist unwittingly interrupts an assassination attempt on another target, who is arrested during interrogation.\n\nThe magistrate discovers the suspect is part of a clandestine anti-communist organization with ties to state police. A military officer is revealed to have bribed the initial assailant. The original witness describes seeing the driver with high-ranking officials.\n\nAs the magistrate prepares to charge military officers, the country's attorney general attempts to discourage the prosecution, suggesting a more limited investigation. Despite pressure, the magistrate proceeds with indictments.\n\nThe epilogue reveals a grim aftermath: the prosecutor is removed from the case, key witnesses die suspiciously, assassins receive light sentences, and officers face only minor reprimands. The deputy's associates are marginalized or exiled. A coup d'Ã©tat occurs, with the military seizing power and implementing widespread cultural suppressions.\n\nThe story concludes with the new regime banning various forms of artistic and intellectual expression, symbolically erasing the memory of the slain deputy and the resistance against oppression."
