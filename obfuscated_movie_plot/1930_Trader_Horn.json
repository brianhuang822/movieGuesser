  "obfuscated_plot": "A documentary-style adventure film follows a bold trader and explorer during a dangerous safari in a remote tropical region. The narrative blends factual and fictional elements, including a dramatic encounter with a mysterious fair-haired woman living in the wilderness, who is revealed to be the long-lost child of a missionary. A particularly memorable sequence depicts the protagonist performing a daring river crossing by swinging on a vine, narrowly escaping the jaws of a massive predatory reptile that threatens to attack him."
