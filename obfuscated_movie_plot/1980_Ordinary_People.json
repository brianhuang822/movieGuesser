  "obfuscated_plot": "A well-off suburban family struggles to cope with a tragic family loss after the accidental death of their older teenage son and the subsequent suicide attempt by their younger son. The surviving son has recently returned from a psychiatric hospital, feeling alienated from his friends and family. He begins seeing a psychiatrist to process his trauma and guilt surrounding the fatal accident that killed his brother.\n\nThe parents have very different coping mechanisms: the father attempts to connect and understand, while the mother tries to maintain a facade of perfection and normality. She appears emotionally distant from her surviving son, seeming to have favored her deceased child. The son works with his therapist to learn emotional management and begins dating a fellow student, which helps him regain some optimism.\n\nFamily tensions escalate, particularly between the mother and son, with arguments frequently occurring and the father attempting to mediate. A critical moment happens during a family gathering when the son confronts his mother about her lack of support during his hospitalization. The parents then take a trip to visit the mother's brother, where the father confronts her about her emotional unavailability.\n\nA significant setback occurs when the son learns that a friend from the psychiatric hospital has died by suicide. Through an intense therapy session, he begins to process his grief and stop blaming himself for his brother's death. However, when he tries to connect emotionally with his mother, she remains unresponsive.\n\nThis leads to a final confrontation where the father questions their relationship and the mother's capacity to love. Ultimately, the mother leaves, and the father and son are left to rebuild their relationship and come to terms with their new family dynamic, affirming their love for each other."
