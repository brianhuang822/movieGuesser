  "obfuscated_plot": "A pool hustler and his partner work a scam in a small town, tricking people into betting against him. They travel to a new city where the hustler challenges a legendary pool player to a high-stakes game. Initially losing, the hustler then gains a significant lead, but his partner urges him to stop. After an epic marathon game lasting 25 hours and fueled by alcohol, the hustler loses everything to the legendary player.\n\nDejected, he meets an alcoholic woman and begins a relationship with her, moving in together. His former partner tries to convince him to return to hustling, but he refuses. A professional gambler who witnessed the original match tells the hustler he has talent but no character, offering to stake him for a future rematch in exchange for most of the winnings.\n\nThe hustler attempts to earn money through more pool hustles but is brutally attacked, resulting in broken thumbs. After recovering, he finally accepts the gambler's terms. They travel to a horse racing event where the hustler plays against a wealthy opponent in a different billiards game. Initially losing, he eventually wins a substantial amount.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, he discovers his girlfriend has committed suicide, apparently driven to despair by the gambler's cruel manipulations. Enraged, the hustler returns to challenge the legendary player again, risking his entire stake. He wins decisively, forcing the legendary player to quit.\n\nThe gambler demands half the winnings and threatens violence, but the hustler shames him by invoking his deceased girlfriend's memory. Ultimately, the gambler bans the hustler from professional pool halls. The two players acknowledge each other's skill, and the hustler walks away triumphant."
