  "obfuscated_plot": "A terminally ill woman on her deathbed tells her daughter about a unique clockmaker who created a memorial clock that ran backwards in an early 20th-century war. She begins reading her partner's extraordinary life story from his diary.\n\nA child is born with the physical characteristics of an elderly man. After his mother dies during childbirth, his wealthy father abandons him at a nursing home. A compassionate caretaker and her partner adopt and raise him. As years pass, he physically ages in reverse, starting in a wheelchair and gradually learning to walk.\n\nHe meets a young girl during childhood, and they form an instant connection. Later, he works on a tugboat, traveling around the world. The girl becomes a talented ballet dancer. During a global conflict, the tugboat crew enters military service, experiencing a devastating naval encounter with an enemy submarine that results in most of the crew's death.\n\nThroughout his unusual life, he has various romantic relationships and encounters. His unusual aging process means he grows younger while chronologically aging normally. He reunites periodically with the girl, now a woman, at different life stages - sometimes romantically, sometimes as friends.\n\nThey eventually have a child together, but he leaves, believing he cannot be a proper father due to his reverse aging. He returns at different points in her life, maintaining a complex relationship. In his later years, he experiences cognitive decline and becomes physically infantile.\n\nThe woman cares for him in his final years, and he dies in her arms as an infant, having lived an entire life in reverse. She reveals to her daughter that he was her daughter's biological father before passing away herself, with the memorial clock continuing to symbolically tick backwards through time."
