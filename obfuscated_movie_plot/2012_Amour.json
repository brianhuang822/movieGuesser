  "obfuscated_plot": "An elderly couple living in an urban apartment building face a health crisis when the wife suffers a series of medical complications. After a stroke initially leaves her partially paralyzed, the husband becomes her dedicated caregiver, promising not to institutionalize her. The wife's condition progressively worsens, with a second stroke rendering her mentally incapacitated and unable to communicate coherently. Despite their daughter's wishes to place the wife in professional care, the husband remains committed to his promise, hiring and firing nurses to support her. Eventually, overwhelmed by her suffering and decline, the husband mercifully smothers his wife while she is bedridden. After her death, he meticulously prepares the apartment, arranging flowers and writing a detailed letter. He symbolically releases a pigeon and experiences a hallucinatory moment where he imagines his wife is still alive and preparing to leave the house. The narrative concludes with their daughter discovering the empty apartment, suggesting the aftermath of her parents' tragic final moments."
