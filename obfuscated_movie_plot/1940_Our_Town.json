A local doctor, his wife, and their two children are neighbors with another family who have a daughter and a younger son. The young man and woman fall in love, and after three years of courting they get married. Time goes by and the woman becomes very sick after the birth of her second child. While she is dying, she encounters all the people who have passed away in previous years.
