  "obfuscated_plot": "A quirky young priest is assigned to an inner-city parish with a struggling school run by nuns. Upon arrival, he learns the school might be closed due to poor conditions. He meets the strict Sister Superior, who believes God will provide for them, and they hope a local wealthy businessman might donate a modern building he owns next to their school.\n\nThe priest and the nun have different approaches to managing the school, often disagreeing but sharing a common goal of saving it. He takes a special interest in a young female student whose mother is trying to rebuild her life. When the student struggles academically, the nun questions her background, but the priest protects the family's privacy.\n\nThe priest and nun help resolve various student issues, including addressing bullying by teaching a student self-defense and boosting another student's confidence. They strategically approach the businessman, suggesting that donating the building could be his lasting legacy. The businessman, advised by his doctor about managing stress, begins performing small acts of kindness and ultimately donates the building to the school.\n\nThe priest reunites the student's parents, surprising her. When the student appears to be failing her exams, the priest and nun debate her future. It's revealed the student intentionally failed to stay with the beloved nun another year. Recognizing the student's true capabilities, the nun allows her to graduate.\n\nHowever, the nun is diagnosed with tuberculosis and must be transferred to a different climate for her health. Initially believing the transfer is due to her conflicts with the priest, she is upset. The priest ultimately reveals the true medical reason for her transfer, and she leaves with hope of returning."
