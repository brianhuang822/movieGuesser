  "obfuscated_plot": "A royal wife gives birth to her fifth child and first son. Despite advisors' pleas, the monarch refuses to end an ongoing war or accept demands for constitutional reforms, believing such actions would weaken his dynasty. As public unrest grows, workers march to the royal palace, hoping to present a petition for political representation. Soldiers fire on the crowd, killing hundreds and sparking a revolution that forces the creation of a representative assembly.\n\nAt a family celebration, the royal wife meets a self-proclaimed holy man with supposed spiritual powers, whom she later turns to for guidance after their son is diagnosed with a serious blood disorder. The close relationship between the holy man and the royal family leads to public ridicule. The monarch eventually dismisses the holy man despite his wife's protests.\n\nA lavish national celebration occurs, but underlying social tensions persist. The prime minister is assassinated, and the monarch responds with harsh repression. After a serious injury to the young heir, the holy man's intervention is credited with saving the child's life.\n\nA major international conflict breaks out, and the monarch takes personal command of the military. His wife is left in charge, but her leadership is viewed with suspicion. Public perception grows that she is influenced by foreign interests and the holy man.\n\nDespite the holy man's later assassination, political instability continues. Workers and soldiers revolt, forcing the monarch to abdicate during a train journey. The entire royal family is exiled to a remote region after no international allies offer them sanctuary.\n\nPolitical upheaval follows, with a new government quickly overthrown by revolutionary forces. Fearing potential restoration of the monarchy, the new revolutionary leaders arrange for the royal family's return. They are brought to a distant city and placed under harsh guard.\n\nIn the middle of the night, the family is awakened and brought to a basement, where they are summarily executed by the guards."
