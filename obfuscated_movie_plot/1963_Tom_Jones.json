  "obfuscated_plot": "A wealthy landowner returns to his estate and discovers a baby in his bed. Thinking that one of his maids and his barber conceived the illegitimate baby out of lust, the landowner banishes them. He names the infant Thomas and chooses to raise him as his own son; Thomas grows up loving him like a father. Thomas becomes a lively young man whose good looks and kind heart make him popular with women. He truly loves only Sarah, daughter of a neighbour, who returns his love. Sarah, too, must hide her feelings while her aunt and father try to coerce her to marry someone they think more suitable, a man who is the son of the landowner's sister. When the sister dies unexpectedly, her son intercepts a letter that his mother intended for his uncle's eyes only. But after his mother's funeral, the son and his two tutors join forces to convince the landowner that Thomas is a villain. The landowner gives Thomas a substantial cash legacy and sends him out into the world to seek his fortune. Thomas is robbed of his fortune, but soon meets his supposed father, who becomes his manservant. Thomas rescues a woman from a soldier, but ends up in a duel and is later jailed and about to be hanged for murder before it is discovered that the letter that the sister had written to the landowner confessed that she is Thomas's mother. It is discovered also that Thomas had not murdered the man in the duel. They are able to reach the jail in time to save Thomas from hanging. Thomas and Sarah are able to marry with everyone's blessing."
