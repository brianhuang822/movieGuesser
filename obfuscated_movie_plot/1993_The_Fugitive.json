  "obfuscated_plot": "A vascular surgeon is arrested for the murder of his wife. Despite insisting he saw a man with a prosthetic arm commit the crime, he is convicted due to circumstantial evidence and sentenced to death. During a prison transport, an escape occurs and the bus crashes near a train. The surgeon escapes, beginning a manhunt led by a relentless deputy marshal. \n\nThe surgeon goes into hiding, infiltrating a hospital and later a medical facility to investigate his wife's murder. He discovers a conspiracy involving a pharmaceutical company and a potentially dangerous drug with harmful side effects. His former colleague is implicated in covering up the drug's medical risks and orchestrating a plot to silence those who oppose it.\n\nPursued by the marshal, the surgeon tracks down the one-armed man he believes killed his wife. He uncovers evidence linking his colleague to the murder and the pharmaceutical company's unethical practices. At a medical conference, he confronts his former colleague, leading to a dramatic chase through the hotel.\n\nDuring a final confrontation, the marshal comes to believe in the surgeon's innocence. The surgeon saves the marshal's life during a fight with his corrupt colleague. In the end, both the one-armed man and the corrupt colleague are arrested. The surgeon surrenders, and the marshal acknowledges his belief in the surgeon's innocence with a subtle hint of respect."
