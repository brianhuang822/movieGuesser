  "obfuscated_plot": "In a historical imperial monarchy, an autocratic ruler governs through fear, paranoia, and erratic cruelty. A tyrant haunted by dread, he lives in constant suspicion of everyone around him, believing he is doomed to be assassinated. Despite his mistrustful nature, he places intermittent trust in one man: his Prime Minister. The minister skillfully manages the emperor like a child, maintaining an unassailable political position. Privately, the minister is in love with a married countess. Their affair is interrupted when her husband unexpectedly returns. As he picks up one of the minister's boots to hurl it out the window in a rage, he is shot and killed by a military guard—following a strict decree that forbids anyone from being visible at a window during the ruler's passage. While the minister is deeply loyal to the nation, he is also tormented by the suffering the ruler inflicts. Torn between duty and patriotism, he determines to bring about the ruler's downfall. He recruits a soldier recently punished for minor uniform violations, promising him vengeance and assigning him as his bodyguard. In the royal palace, the ruler obsesses over trivialities while foreign and domestic affairs languish. Meanwhile, the minister begins to rally conspirators at court. He appeals to the crown prince, an idealist who dreams of a better future. But when the prince refuses to support treason, the minister reports him to the ruler as a traitor, knowing the emperor already resents his son's popularity. The ruler immediately places the prince under arrest. With the conspiracy in motion, the minister devises a plan: the ruler will be pressured to abdicate, and if he refuses, he will be assassinated. But the ruler suddenly announces he is leaving the city with his mistress, derailing the carefully timed plot. To keep the ruler in the capital, the minister shows him a snuff box with a hidden portrait of the countess. Obsessed, the ruler cancels his trip and demands to meet her. The minister orchestrates the meeting and deliberately leaves them alone. The ruler clumsily propositions her. Betrayed and disgusted, the countess reveals the minister's plot to assassinate him. Summoning the minister, the ruler demands an explanation. Calmly, the minister claims he infiltrated the conspiracy to expose the plotters. He offers his life in exchange for the ruler's trust. Satisfied, the ruler retires to his chambers. That night, the assassination proceeds. As the ruler lies in uneasy sleep, conspirators enter his room. He pleads with them: \"I rule by Divine Right!\"—but his words delay, not deter. From behind, the recruited soldier emerges and murders the ruler. Outside, bells toll and the people celebrate the rise of the new emperor. In his study, the minister awaits the cost of his actions. The soldier appears with a pistol. As the clock strikes the hour, a shot rings out—the minister is mortally wounded. The countess arrives too late. Cradled in her arms, the minister declares with his final breath: \"I have been a bad friend and lover—but I have been a 'Patriot'.\""
