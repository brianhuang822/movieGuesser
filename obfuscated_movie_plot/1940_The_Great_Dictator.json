  "obfuscated_plot": "During a global conflict in the early 20th century, a Jewish soldier fighting for his nation saves the life of a wounded military commander, who carries important documents. After their plane crashes, the soldier develops amnesia. Twenty years later, the soldier returns to his previous profession as a barber in a ghetto now controlled by the commander, who has risen in the ranks of a newly formed fascist regime under a ruthless dictator. The barber falls in love with a neighbor, and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. After being captured, the barber is saved when the commander recognizes him and helps him regain his memory.\n\nThe dictator attempts to finance his military by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but when the banker refuses, he orders a purge of the Jewish population. The commander protests this policy and is sent to a prison camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Troops search the ghetto and arrest both men, sending them to the camp. The barber's love interest and her family flee to a neighboring country.\n\nThe dictator disputes with another dictator from a rival nation about invading the neighboring country. After a comical negotiation involving a food fight, they sign a treaty and launch the invasion. The Jewish family is trapped and beaten by soldiers.\n\nEscaping the camp in stolen uniforms, the commander and barber arrive at the invasion's frontier. Through a series of mistaken identities, the barber is pushed to the victory parade platform. Impersonating the dictator, he delivers a powerful speech about brotherhood, democracy, and hope, broadcasting a message of unity and freedom to the oppressed people, including a direct message of hope to his love interest."
