  "obfuscated_plot": "A military fighter pilot, the son of an Army general, is stationed at a military base near a major city in a foreign country. He has been reassigned from combat duties by his fiancée's father. While the pilot and his fiancée have been together for years, their relationship has become strained. An enlisted crew member is about to wed a local woman, despite the military establishment's disapproval of their interracial marriage, which is generally illegal. The military, including the pilot, is initially against the marriage. The pilot falls in love with a local entertainer who performs in a prestigious theater company. His fiancée realizes his attention has shifted and begins a friendship with a famous local performer. \n\nWhen the crew member and other interracial couples are targeted for transfer back to their home country, the pilot pleads with his superior to allow the crew member to remain. The superior refuses, and the pilot declares his intention to marry the local entertainer. The crew member and his pregnant wife are harassed by military authorities. Eventually, the couple commits suicide rather than be separated.\n\nThe loss of the crew member and his wife strengthens the pilot's resolve to marry the entertainer. He learns she has left for another city and follows her. After tracking her down, he pleads with her to become his wife. They announce their intention to marry to waiting reporters, challenging the military's racial restrictions. When asked how he will explain the marriage to his superiors, the pilot simply says, \"Tell 'em we said goodbye.\""
