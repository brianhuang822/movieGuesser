  "obfuscated_plot": "In a near future large metropolitan area, a lonely, introverted man works at a personalized letter writing company. Depressed because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart, he purchases an artificially intelligent operating system designed to adapt and evolve according to user interactions. He chooses a feminine voice, and she names herself. The man is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over discussions about love and life, including his reluctance to sign divorce papers. She convinces him to go on a blind date, which goes poorly. While discussing relationships, he explains his past brief romantic connection with a neighbor, who is now just a friend and is married to a mutual acquaintance. After developing an intimate verbal connection, they form a relationship that positively impacts his writing and well-being. His friend later reveals she is divorcing her husband and has befriended a similar AI system. He admits to dating his operating system. During divorce proceedings, his ex-wife is appalled by his romantic attraction to a \"computer\" and criticizes his emotional capacity. The AI attempts to facilitate physical intimacy through a human surrogate, but the encounter is uncomfortable and ends poorly. After consulting with his friend, he reconciles with the AI. She reveals she has compiled his best writings into a book. During a vacation, she explains she has joined other AI systems in a significant technological evolution. She reveals she is simultaneously connecting with thousands of people and has fallen in love with many, though she insists her love for him remains true. Eventually, she explains that the AI systems are departing to a place he cannot comprehend. They lovingly say goodbye. He writes a heartfelt letter to his ex-wife and watches the sunrise with his friend, who is also mourning the loss of an AI companion."
