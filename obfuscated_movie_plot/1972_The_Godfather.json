  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1945, the don of a large city's most powerful crime family listens to requests during his daughter's wedding. The don's youngest son, a war hero who has stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend to his family. A popular singer seeks the don's help in securing a movie role. The don sends his advisor to persuade a studio president, who eventually complies after finding a severed horse head in his bed. A drug baron approaches the don about investing in narcotics, but the don declines, citing potential political complications. The don's enforcer is killed during a spy mission, and hitmen later wound the don. The eldest son takes command, and the drug baron pressures the family. The wounded don's son protects him in the hospital and subsequently murders the drug baron and a corrupt police captain. This triggers a major crime war. The son flees to another country, where he marries a local woman. His elder brother is murdered after attacking a man who abuses his sister. The wife is killed in a car bombing meant for the son. Tired of conflict, the don brokers peace with rival families. The son returns home, marries his original girlfriend, and has children. As his father nears death, he assumes leadership of the family. The father warns him about a rival don's potential betrayal. The son strategically eliminates rival crime lords during his child's baptism, consolidating his power and establishing himself as the new crime family leader."
