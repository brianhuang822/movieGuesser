  "obfuscated_plot": "A young college student creates a popular social networking website after being dumped by his girlfriend. He hacks his university's photo database to create a website rating students' attractiveness, which leads to academic probation. Two athletic students and their business partner approach him about developing a campus dating website, but he instead develops his own social networking platform with seed funding from his best friend.\n\nThe website rapidly expands from an elite university network to multiple prestigious academic institutions. His best friend provides initial business support but becomes increasingly marginalized as a charismatic tech entrepreneur becomes involved. The entrepreneur helps the founder relocate the company to a tech hub and introduces ambitious growth strategies.\n\nTensions rise when the best friend discovers his ownership stake has been dramatically reduced without his knowledge. He is removed from the company after confronting the founder, leading to legal action. Meanwhile, the original athletic students who claim the idea was stolen also pursue a lawsuit.\n\nThe tech entrepreneur is later arrested for drug-related charges, which further complicates the company's early history. A junior lawyer advises the founder that settling the lawsuits would be prudent to avoid negative public perception.\n\nThe story concludes with the founder, now immensely wealthy, attempting to reconnect with the girlfriend who initially rejected him, symbolizing his complex personal journey. Legal documents reveal both lawsuits were ultimately settled out of court, and the founder becomes the youngest billionaire in his industry."
