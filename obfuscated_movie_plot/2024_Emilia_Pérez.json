  "obfuscated_plot": "A struggling attorney in a large city leads the defense in a murder case involving a prominent media figure's wife. Against her own conscience, she argues that the woman died by suicide. After winning the case, she receives an anonymous call with a mysterious but lucrative offer. Reflecting on her discontent, she agrees to a meeting. Her client, a powerful criminal leader, expresses the desire to covertly undergo gender-affirming surgery and begin a new and authentic life as a woman. After consulting with doctors in two different countries, she finds a surgeon who agrees to perform the procedure after hearing the client's recollections of gender dysphoria during childhood. Following the procedure, the client's wife and children are relocated to a neutral European country. The wife pleads to go to another country but is told the current location was chosen for their safety. The attorney is paid an exorbitant sum for her services. Meanwhile, the criminal fakes their death and begins a new life as a woman.\n\nFour years later in another European city, the attorney encounters her former client, who wants to reunite with her children. The attorney arranges for the wife and children to return to their home city, introducing the transformed criminal as a distant, wealthy relative who has volunteered to help raise the children. The wife does not recognize her and opposes the arrangement, ultimately agreeing to return only to reunite with a past lover.\n\nAdjusting to their new life, the attorney and the transformed criminal have a chance encounter with the mother of a missing child. The criminal reflects on her criminal past. Later, as she puts her son to bed, he says he still recognizes her scent. Remorseful, she uses her connections with incarcerated criminals to create a nonprofit that identifies victims' bodies in order to return them to their families.\n\nThe attorney and the transformed criminal collaborate in building the nonprofit and recruiting donors. A woman whose abusive husband's remains were identified by the nonprofit meets with the transformed criminal, and they subsequently begin a relationship. Meanwhile, the wife continues rekindling her relationship with her lover. When the transformed criminal becomes possessive and aggressive, the wife flees with the children.\n\nAfter cutting off the wife's financial support and threatening her lover, the wife and lover kidnap the transformed criminal and demand ransom. A rescue attempt leads to a confrontation where the transformed criminal reveals her true identity to the wife. During a subsequent car chase, the wife, lover, and transformed criminal are killed in an accident. The devastated attorney offers to be the children's guardian, while a new romantic partner mourns and celebrates the transformed criminal's fight for truth and freedom."
