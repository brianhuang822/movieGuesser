  "obfuscated_plot": "A lawyer who works as a \"fixer\" for a prestigious law firm in a large city is assigned to manage a crisis involving a colleague who has a mental breakdown during an important legal case. The colleague, suffering from an untreated mental condition, threatens to expose damaging information about a major agricultural corporation being sued for causing numerous deaths.\n\nThe fixer tries to control the situation, dealing with his colleague's erratic behavior while also managing his own personal financial troubles. His young son inadvertently provides inspiration to his unstable colleague, who becomes determined to reveal corporate wrongdoing.\n\nThe corporate legal counsel becomes aware of a confidential memo that could prove the company's guilt and hires operatives to track and ultimately eliminate the unstable colleague. They murder him and stage it as a drug overdose.\n\nThe fixer becomes suspicious about the death and begins investigating, discovering his colleague had made copies of an incriminating document. With help from his police officer brother, he gathers evidence and learns about the corporate coverup.\n\nThe corporation attempts to silence the fixer by planting a bomb in his car, but he survives with his brother's assistance. In a final confrontation, he tricks the corporate legal counsel into admitting wrongdoing while wearing a wire, leading to police intervention. He then escapes in a taxi, having exposed the corporation's criminal activities."
