  "obfuscated_plot": "A music student attends a performance of a ballet by an eminent travelling ballet company. He walks out after discovering his professor plagiarized his compositions. At an after-party, a young dancer tells the company's impresario that dancing is the most important thing in her life, and he invites her to join the company. After watching her dance a lead role, he hires her full-time.\n\nThe student writes a letter exposing his professor's misconduct but is sympathetic when the impresario reads it. The impresario hires him as an assistant and conductor. The company's principal dancer leaves upon getting married, and the impresario casts the young dancer as the lead in a new ballet about magical red shoes that enable superhuman dancing but ultimately lead to the dancer's death.\n\nDuring rehearsals, the student and dancer initially clash but develop mutual artistic respect. The ballet becomes a massive success, and they fall in love. The possessive impresario tries to break up their relationship, giving the student an ultimatum to leave the company or end the romance.\n\nThe couple marries and moves to a large city, where their careers diverge. The dancer's career stalls while the student prepares an opera. During a holiday, the impresario convinces the dancer to return to performing. On the night of the opera's premiere, the student rushes to stop her, leading to a confrontation about art versus love.\n\nTorn, the dancer chooses to perform. Wearing the magical red shoes and looking faint, she suddenly runs away and jumps in front of a train, mirroring the tragic ballet's storyline. The student fails to save her. As she dies, she asks him to remove the red shoes. The shaken impresario announces her permanent inability to perform, and the company performs the ballet with a spotlight on her empty space."
