  "obfuscated_plot": "After a major political scandal, 400 million people worldwide watch on television as a disgraced former national leader departs his government's headquarters following his resignation. A prominent talk show host watches from abroad and is inspired to pursue an interview with the fallen leader. The leader's agent believes the interviews would allow him to salvage his reputation and profit financially. The leader agrees to a deal with the host. The host persuades his friend and producer of the interviews' potential for success and they travel to meet the leader. The host begins a romantic relationship with a woman he meets during travel. Unable to sell the interviews to major networks, the host finances the project with private money, brokering deals with advertisers and local television stations. Two researchers are hired to help the host prepare. One researcher presses the host to prioritize getting a confession about the scandal. Under scrutiny by the leader's chief of staff, the host and leader begin recording interview sessions. The host is restricted by time limits and allows the leader to dominate discussions about war and policy. The host's team questions his abilities, angry that the leader has been permitted to rehabilitate his damaged image. The host is distracted by poor sponsorship and professional setbacks. Before the final interview, the host receives a late-night phone call from an inebriated leader who declares the interview will make or break their careers. The conversation energizes the host who works relentlessly to prepare. A researcher pursues a critical piece of evidence at a local courthouse. The host ambushes the leader in the final interview with damning transcripts. To his team's horror, the leader admits to unethical actions, declaring that his position makes his actions legitimate. A stunned host nearly obtains a full confession before being interrupted. When the interview resumes, the leader ultimately admits to participating in a cover-up and \"letting the people down.\" After the interviews air, the host visits the leader, and they part with mutual respect. The host gifts the leader a pair of shoes. In a final moment, the leader implies he doesn't recall a previous significant phone conversation. The interviews are later revealed to be wildly successful, and the leader never fully escaped controversy until his death."
