  "obfuscated_plot": "A wealthy businessman's son is a troublemaker at his private boarding school, leading to his suspension. To improve their relationship, the father takes the son on a business trip overseas by steamship. During the voyage, the son falls overboard and is rescued by a fisherman from a small fishing vessel. The ship's captain is skeptical of the son's background and refuses to immediately return him to their home city. Instead, he offers the son a chance to work as a temporary crew member for several months.\n\nInitially reluctant, the son gradually adapts to the demanding fishing lifestyle, guided by the kind fisherman who rescued him and encouraged by the captain's son. He learns to work hard and becomes integrated into the ship's crew. An incident involving a prank that injures another crew member is defended by the kind fisherman.\n\nAfter a successful fishing expedition, the ship begins its return journey. During a critical moment, the fisherman climbs the mast to adjust the sail when the mast suddenly breaks. He becomes entangled in the rigging and is severely injured. Knowing he will die, he asks to be cut free to prevent endangering the ship, refusing to let the young boy witness his final moments.\n\nUpon returning to port, the son is reunited with his father. He is deeply grief-stricken by the fisherman's death, initially pushing his father away. The captain reassures the father about his son's emotional growth. At a memorial service, the son honors the fisherman's memory, lighting candles and praying.\n\nThe story concludes with the father and son driving home, the son's fishing boat in tow, with the boy animatedly sharing stories of his maritime adventure, now reconciled and closer than before."
