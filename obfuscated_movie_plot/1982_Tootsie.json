  "obfuscated_plot": "An actor struggling to find work in a large city is consistently rejected due to his perfectionist nature. To support himself, he works as a server and teaches acting classes. After months without acting work, he learns of an audition for a daytime soap opera from a female acting student who unsuccessfully tries out for a lead role. In desperation, he disguises himself as a woman and auditions, successfully landing the part.\n\nHis motivation is to earn money to help produce a play for his roommate, which will star himself and the female student. As his female alter ego, he portrays the character differently than expected, becoming a surprising feminist icon and national sensation. When his female student discovers him trying on women's clothes, he deflects by suggesting sexual interest, and they subsequently become intimate.\n\nMeanwhile, he becomes attracted to a female co-star, a single mother involved with the show's inappropriate director. After some complicated romantic interactions and misunderstandings, his female persona attracts additional admirers, including an older cast member and the female co-star's widowed father, who even proposes marriage.\n\nThe situation becomes increasingly complex when the show's producers want to extend his contract. He resolves this by dramatically improvising a plot twist during a live broadcast, revealing his character as a twin who has taken over the role. This creates chaos, and his female co-star becomes furious upon discovering his deception.\n\nEventually, he reconciles with various characters, including the co-star's father. He ultimately reconnects with the female co-star, reflecting on how his female persona allowed him to be a more empathetic and better person. They tentatively reunite, suggesting potential romantic reconciliation."
