  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century, a young man is born into a large working-class family. Doctors discover he has severe cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk. He is loved and supported by his family, especially his mother. One day, his mother trips down the stairs while in labour, and he is the only person home to see it. He alerts some neighbours to help. His father never believed he would amount to anything, but becomes proud after witnessing him use his left foot, the only body part he can fully control, to write the word \"mother\" on the floor with a piece of chalk. Consequently, he seeks a hobby in painting. The neighbourhood youngsters include him in their activities, like street football, but when he paints a picture and gives it to a girl he likes, she returns it. Later, his father loses his job and the family faces exceptionally difficult hardships, so he devises a plan to help his brothers steal coal to their mother's dismay. His mother, who has been gradually gathering some savings in a tin in the fireplace, finally saves enough to buy him a wheelchair. He is then introduced to a woman who takes him to her school for cerebral palsy patients and persuades a friend to hold an exhibition of his work. He falls in love with her, but when he learns during a dinner that she is engaged to be married, he considers suicide. His mother helps him build a private studio for himself, but soon afterward his father dies of a stroke, and during the wake he instigates a brawl. At this point, he starts writing his autobiography. The woman returns and they resume their friendship. Later, he attends a charity event where he meets his handler, a nurse. She begins reading his autobiography. He asks her to go out with him and they then happily leave the event together."
