Initially reluctant, the valet accompanies the husband to a European city, where he experiences a night of drinking that loosens his traditionally rigid demeanor. The couple returns to their small town in America, where the valet is mistakenly perceived as a wealthy retired gentleman.\n\nHe becomes integrated into the local society, forming a relationship with a widowed housewife and learning about the country's history. After being fired by a snobbish relative of the couple, he decides to become an independent person. In a dramatic moment at a local saloon, he recites a famous historical speech from memory, symbolizing his embrace of personal freedom.\n\nThe valet decides to open a restaurant, despite potential interference from his former aristocratic employer who travels to buy him back. At a crucial moment, he declares his intention to live on his own terms. The restaurant's opening is a success, with all his newfound friends in attendance. When a condescending relative insults him, he throws the man out.\n\nInitially believing he has ruined his social standing, the valet is surprised to find the entire restaurant celebrating him, ultimately affirming his journey from servant to independent business owner and his successful integration into a new society."
