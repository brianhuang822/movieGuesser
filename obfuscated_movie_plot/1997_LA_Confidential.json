  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-20th century, a metropolitan police department aims to improve its public image following decades of corruption. A career-focused sergeant lives in the shadow of his legendary detective father, whose murderer was never identified; he names the suspect representing any criminal who escapes justice. A fame-seeking narcotics sergeant collaborates with a tabloid journalist to perform high-profile celebrity arrests, and a volatile officer uses violence to interrogate suspects, particularly those who abuse women. On a holiday eve, the officer encounters high-class sex workers who work for a wealthy businessman operating a clandestine prostitution ring hosting women surgically altered to resemble film stars. The officer begins a relationship with one of the workers. Following a police brutality scandal, the sergeant is promoted to detective lieutenant after persuading his superiors to save the department's reputation. A series of murders targeting local criminals leads to the disappearance of a significant amount of heroin. A massacre at a coffee house results in multiple victims, and three minority suspects are arrested. The officer executes one of the suspects' captors and plants evidence to suggest self-defense. Despite closing the case initially, the sergeant and officer continue investigating independently. They uncover a complex conspiracy involving corrupt police leadership, blackmail, and a power struggle to control the criminal underworld. Through a series of confrontations and revelations, they expose a senior officer's elaborate plot to take over the criminal empire. In a final confrontation, they kill the corrupt officer, but the police department decides to protect its image by portraying the corrupt officer as a hero. The sergeant agrees to this narrative in exchange for professional advancement, and the main characters part ways."
