  "obfuscated_plot": "A stage actor and director lives in a major Asian city with his wife, a screenwriter who conceives her stories after sex and narrates them to him. He learns his lines by listening to tapes recorded by his wife while driving his red sports car. After he performs in a famous absurdist play, his wife introduces him to a young television star. When a theater festival he was slated to judge is delayed, he returns home, where he finds his wife having sex with the young actor, but does not disturb them. After a car crash, he discovers he has an eye disease in one eye and must take medication to prevent blindness. One day, his wife asks to have a serious conversation with him. After he spends the day driving alone, he returns home to find his wife dead from a brain hemorrhage. After the funeral, he breaks down while performing the title role in a classic Russian play. Two years later, he accepts a residency in another city to direct a multilingual production of the same Russian play. The theatre festival requires that he be chauffeured in his own car for insurance reasons, and despite his initial reluctance, he eventually bonds with his reserved young female driver. With the help of a dramaturge, he casts a diverse group of actors to perform in their native languages. He is impressed by a mute actress who communicates in sign language, and he also unexpectedly casts the young television actor in the title role. After a rehearsal, the young actor invites him for a drink, where the young actor pushes against harsh assessments of his character but admits to his unrequited love for the director's late wife. He scolds someone for taking a photo of him. The dramaturge invites the director and his driver to dinner with his wife, who is revealed to be the mute actress. Driving home, the driver tells the director about driving her abusive mother for long hours at a young age. They later visit a garbage facility, where the driver explains that she drove garbage trucks after leaving her hometown when a landslide destroyed her home and killed her mother. Drinking with the young actor again, the director reveals that he thinks he can no longer play the title role himself, and suggests that the young actor's lack of self-control is a personal weakness but a strength as an actor. After the young actor slips away to confront a man taking photos of him, the driver takes them home. The director reveals that he and his wife lost their young daughter, who would now be the driver's age; his wife's gift for telling stories after sex was a bond that helped them both cope. Though he knew of his wife's affairs, the director believes she still loved him, and the young actor shares one of the wife's stories that the director never heard in its entirety. The police interrupt a rehearsal and arrest the young actor, as the man he attacked has died from his injuries. Given two days to consider whether to take over the title role or else cancel the production, the director asks the driver to take him to her childhood home in a northern region. The director shares his guilt for not coming home to face the discussion his wife wanted to have, which might have allowed him to save her life. The driver reveals that she escaped the landslide but chose not to pull her mother from the wreckage, receiving a scar on her cheek she has chosen not to have treated. They visit the snowy remains of the driver's childhood home and embrace as they both confront their shared grief. The director assumes the title role and gives an impassioned performance before a live audience, including the driver. The mute actress meaningfully delivers the final lines about rest and peace and seeing angels. Actors and audience alike are moved by the performance. Some time later, the driver is living in another Asian country. Buying groceries, she returns to the director's red sports car, in which a dog rests. She takes off her face mask, revealing that her scar is now barely visible, and drives away."
