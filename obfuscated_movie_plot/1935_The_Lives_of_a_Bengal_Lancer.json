  "obfuscated_plot": "During a colonial conflict in a mountainous frontier region, a senior military officer welcomes two new replacements to a cavalry unit: an experienced cavalryman and a young, newly commissioned officer who is the son of the unit's commanding officer. The young officer discovers his father did not specifically request his presence and feels deeply rejected, leading to emotional distress. An intelligence officer reports that a local rebel leader is planning an uprising and intends to intercept a critical military convoy carrying ammunition. A foreign agent is tasked with seducing and kidnapping the young officer to extract strategic information. When the commanding officer refuses to attempt a rescue, two other officers leave camp without authorization to save the young officer. Disguised as local merchants, they infiltrate the rebel stronghold but are captured and tortured. Under extreme duress, the demoralized young officer reveals convoy details, resulting in the ammunition being stolen. The cavalry unit then launches an attack on the rebel fortress. During the battle, the captured officers escape and help destroy the ammunition supplies. The young officer redeems himself by killing the rebel leader, and the remaining rebels surrender. In recognition of their bravery, the surviving officers are awarded high military honors, with the deceased heroic officer receiving a posthumous medal of valor, symbolically placed on his horse by the commanding officer."
