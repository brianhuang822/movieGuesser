  "obfuscated_plot": "A military general at a remote air base orders his executive officer to launch a nuclear attack on a rival nation, putting the base on maximum alert. The bomber planes are armed with thermonuclear weapons and flying toward their targets. The executive officer realizes the attack is unauthorized and tries to stop the general, who is suffering from paranoid delusions about water contamination.\n\nIn the government's central war room, military and political leaders discuss the potential nuclear conflict. The president brings in the ambassador from the rival nation to warn them of the impending attack. The rival nation reveals they have a secret doomsday device that will automatically trigger massive nuclear destruction if attacked.\n\nThe military attempts to stop the rogue general, who ultimately commits suicide. His executive officer manages to find a communication code that allows most bomber planes to be recalled. However, one bomber, led by a determined pilot, continues its mission due to damaged communication equipment.\n\nThe pilot manually repairs the bomb bay and, when the bomb is released, dramatically rides it down to his own destruction. In the war room, a scientific advisor proposes underground survival plans, with military leaders expressing concern about potential enemy preparations.\n\nThe scene concludes with a surreal moment of the scientific advisor suddenly standing from his wheelchair, followed by a montage of nuclear explosions, suggesting the activation of the doomsday device and global destruction."
