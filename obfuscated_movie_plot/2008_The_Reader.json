Weeks later, after recovering, he visits her with flowers to express gratitude. They begin a secret summer love affair, with the woman often requesting the boy read to her. During a cycling holiday, the boy notices peculiarities in her behavior. Their passionate relationship grows complex, with his attempts to form a deeper connection frustrated by her secretive nature. When she is promoted at work, she abruptly quits without explanation. Years later, the boy, now a law student, discovers his former lover is on trial as a former prison guard accused of war crimes during a historical conflict. She is charged with being complicit in the deaths of hundreds of prisoners during a forced march, having participated in selecting victims for execution and preventing their escape during a deadly incident involving a burning building. During the trial, it is revealed that her illiteracy was a significant factor in her actions and testimony. The woman is sentenced to life imprisonment. Throughout the following decades, the man remains haunted by their relationship. He periodically sends her recorded readings of books, which she uses to teach herself literacy. When she is near release, she commits suicide, leaving instructions for him to contact a Holocaust survivor. He meets the survivor, who initially refuses her reparation money but ultimately agrees to donate it to a literacy organization. The story concludes with the man sharing their complicated history with his daughter while visiting the woman's grave."
