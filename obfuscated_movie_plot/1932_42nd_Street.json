  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1932, during the depths of an economic depression, two Broadway producers are staging a musical starring a lead actress. She is involved with a wealthy financial backer, but is secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner, who is out of work. The director is hired, though his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite past successes, he is impoverished following a major economic crash, so he must make his last show a hit to earn enough money to retire. Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition. A newcomer is ignored until two experienced dancers take her under their wing. One dancer is assured a job because of her relationship with the dance director, and she ensures that her friends are chosen. The newcomer is tricked into bursting into the dressing room of the show's lead actor, who takes an immediate liking to her. When the director learns about the lead actress's relationship with her partner, he sends some thugs to intimidate him. The couple agrees not to see each other for a while. Rehearsals continue for five weeks, to the director's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's surprise opening, when the lead actress breaks her ankle. By the next morning, the financial backer has quarreled with her and wants to replace her with his new girlfriend. The girlfriend confesses that she cannot carry the show but convinces the director that the inexperienced newcomer can. The director is desperate and rehearses the newcomer mercilessly until an hour before the premiere. The lead actor finally musters the nerve to tell the newcomer that he loves her. They embrace and kiss, just as the lead actress appears and walks through the door. She wishes the newcomer luck and reveals that she and her partner are finally getting married. The show is staged to rousing applause. As the theater audience leaves, the director stands in the shadows outside the stage door, hearing comments that the newcomer is the star and that he does not deserve the credit for the show's success."
