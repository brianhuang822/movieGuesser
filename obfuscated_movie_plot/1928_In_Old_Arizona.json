  "obfuscated_plot": "In a southwestern frontier region, a notorious outlaw robs a stagecoach. Word of this deed reaches a determined sergeant, who is tasked by his superior to capture or kill the outlaw, with a substantial reward promised. They meet in a barber shop, though the sergeant is unaware of the outlaw's true identity and passes him off as a friendly civilian. When he leaves, a local blacksmith reveals the outlaw's identity, much to the sergeant's surprise. The outlaw is in a relationship with a local woman, and visits her often. He loves her, but she has frequent affairs without his knowledge. The sergeant and the woman meet each other and begin an affair. The sergeant tells her that once he takes down the outlaw, he will give the reward money to her, making her fall in love with him. They express their love for each other while the outlaw secretly watches and listens nearby, learning of her betrayal. She writes a secret letter to the sergeant telling him to come that evening to take down the outlaw before he makes his escape. However, the outlaw finds this letter and replaces it with a fake letter \"from her\" which he has written himself. His letter says that he will be dressed up in her clothes in an effort to disguise himself from the sergeant, while she is actually in the outlaw's clothes riding away. The sergeant receives this fake letter, believing it to be from her. When the outlaw leaves her house, the sergeant shoots her, believing her to be the outlaw in disguise. Now farther away, the outlaw laments that \"[her] flirting days are over, and she can finally settle down\". He then makes his escape."
