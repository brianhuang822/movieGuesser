  "obfuscated_plot": "In a mid-20th century postwar period in a European country, a butler of a grand country estate receives a letter from a former housekeeper, now married. Their previous employer, a noble aristocrat, has died in disgrace after his pre-World War II support of a totalitarian regime, and his estate has been sold to a retired American politician. The butler borrows a luxury car and travels to the countryside to meet the former housekeeper for the first time in decades.\n\nIn the 1930s, the housekeeper arrives at the estate, where the buttoned-up butler derives his entire identity from his profession. They initially clash, particularly when he refuses to acknowledge his aging father can no longer work. During a conference of fascist-sympathizing aristocrats, the butler maintains total professionalism even as his father lies dying. An American politician warns of impending political disaster.\n\nInfluenced by oppressive racial policies, the aristocrat forces the butler to dismiss two refugee maids. The housekeeper threatens to resign but has nowhere to go. Despite growing tension, they develop a complicated relationship. The butler remains emotionally detached, while the housekeeper clearly develops feelings for him.\n\nA young journalist arrives during a secret diplomatic meeting, criticizing the aristocrat's involvement in appeasing a dangerous political regime. The housekeeper accepts a marriage proposal from another man, and when she tells the butler, he offers only professional congratulations. She leaves before the war begins.\n\nYears later, during his journey to meet the housekeeper, the butler is helped by a local doctor who probes his past. They discuss the aristocrat's misguided political sympathies. When they finally meet, they have a bittersweet reunion, both acknowledging the missed opportunities of their past.\n\nThe housekeeper decides to remain near her pregnant daughter, and they part fondly but sadly. The butler returns to the estate, where the new owner symbolically releases a trapped bird, mirroring the butler's own emotional liberation."
