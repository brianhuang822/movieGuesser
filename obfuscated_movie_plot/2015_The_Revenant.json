  "obfuscated_plot": "A fur trapper watches as soldiers burn down a Native American village on a vast prairie. Years later, during a territorial conflict, the trapper guides a group of hunters through a remote wilderness region. While hunting with his mixed-race son, their camp is attacked by a war party seeking to recover an abducted daughter. Many hunters are killed, with survivors escaping by boat.\n\nGuided by the trapper, the survivors begin a dangerous journey on foot. While scouting, the trapper is severely mauled by a bear and left near death. A fellow hunter argues they should mercy-kill the trapper and continue moving. The group's leader offers payment for someone to stay and bury the trapper after he dies.\n\nThe trapper's son and a young hunter volunteer to stay, alongside another hunter motivated by the money. After the group departs, the mercenary hunter attempts to kill the trapper and successfully murders his son. He convinces the young hunter to abandon the critically injured trapper, claiming imminent danger.\n\nThe trapper survives and begins an arduous wilderness journey, healing his wounds and evading pursuers. He encounters a refugee who shares wisdom about revenge and temporarily travels with him. After the refugee is killed by foreign hunters, the trapper rescues an abducted woman and continues his quest for survival and potential retribution.\n\nEventually, the trapper confronts the man responsible for his son's death in a brutal final encounter. Instead of killing him directly, the trapper allows native warriors to execute his enemy. The story concludes with the trapper retreating into the mountains, haunted by visions of his deceased wife."
