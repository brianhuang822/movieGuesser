  "obfuscated_plot": "During a mid-19th century civil war, a wounded military lieutenant, facing potential leg amputation, performs a bold suicide mission on horseback, which unexpectedly turns into a heroic moment. Surviving, he requests a frontier posting and arrives at a remote military outpost. Finding the location abandoned, he decides to rebuild and maintain the fort.\n\nAfter encountering a local indigenous tribe, he gradually develops a relationship with them, learning their language and culture. He befriends a wolf and becomes integrated into the tribe's community. A white woman who was adopted by the tribe becomes his interpreter and eventual romantic partner.\n\nThe lieutenant helps the tribe during a buffalo hunt and provides them with firearms to defend against rival tribes. He earns the tribe's respect and eventually marries the adopted woman. When the tribe decides to relocate for winter, he attempts to retrieve his personal diary from the fort.\n\nUpon returning to the fort, he is mistaken for an enemy, captured, and accused of desertion. His horse is killed, and his wolf companion is shot while trying to follow him. The indigenous tribe rescues him from military custody, and he ultimately leaves with his wife to protect the tribe from potential retaliation.\n\nThe narrative concludes with the suggestion that the indigenous group continues to evade government forces, with their ultimate surrender occurring over a decade later."
