  "obfuscated_plot": "During a global conflict, a 17-year-old young soldier enthusiastically enlists in his country's army alongside schoolmates. The friends are deployed near a rural battlefield and are befriended by an older, experienced soldier. Their romanticism is shattered by the realities of trench warfare, and one of them is killed by artillery the first night. As peace negotiations begin, the soldiers try to survive their final days. They steal food, share moments of camaraderie, and witness the war's brutal impact on their lives. One soldier spends a night with a local woman and keeps her scarf as a memento. Government officials negotiate a ceasefire while military leaders resist surrender. The young soldiers are ordered into a final assault, experiencing savage hand-to-hand combat and devastating technological warfare. Trapped in a crater, one soldier kills an enemy combatant and is haunted by the painful death. As political leaders negotiate surrender, the soldiers face their imminent fate. One wounded soldier, knowing he will lose his leg, takes his own life. In the war's final moments, the main character and his mentor attempt one last raid, but the mentor is fatally shot. Just before the ceasefire takes effect, the young soldier is killed in battle, moments away from survival. Another young soldier who was previously saved finds his body and takes his friend's memento, leaving behind the identification that will mark his final resting place."
