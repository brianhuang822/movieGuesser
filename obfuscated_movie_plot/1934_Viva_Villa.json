  "obfuscated_plot": "A young man sees his poor father lose his land and be whipped to death for protesting, so he stabs one of the killers and flees into the hills of a rural region during the 1880s. As a grown man, he and a band of rebel bandits, including his trusted ally, kill wealthy landowners and become heroes to their fellow poor workers. A wealthy aristocrat arranges an introduction to a distinguished and eloquent revolutionary leader who resents the current government and persuades the rebel to help fight for liberty, not just personal gain. The coarse and illiterate rebel is humbled in the leader's presence and agrees to fight for his cause. He is also attracted to the aristocrat's beautiful sister, although he has many women in his life, including a wife. His exploits are made more colorful by an American newspaper reporter to whom he has taken a great liking. While drunk, the reporter is misinformed and reports a false victory, which prompts the rebel to stage actual raids on villages, disobeying his leader's orders. The revolutionary leader assumes office and commands the rebel to disband his personal army. The rebel agrees, but when his ally kills a bank teller, he ends up sentenced to death. A mocking general instead exiles him. Alone and drunk in a border town, feeling forsaken, he learns that his leader has been assassinated. He returns and rebuilds his army, storming the capital and defeating the general. He takes what he wants, but when the aristocrat's sister resists his advances and draws a gun, his ally murders her. He appoints himself leader but is ineffectual, unable to restore the revolutionary dream of land reform. He agrees to step aside and return to his previous life. Before he can, with the reporter by his side, he is gunned down by the aristocrat seeking revenge. The reporter vows to keep his memory alive, telling his dying friend that he is no longer news, but history."
