  "obfuscated_plot": "In a large 19th-century mansion with red walls and carpets, a woman is dying of uterine cancer. Her two sisters arrive at their childhood home and take turns with the maid watching over her. The maid, more religious, prays after losing her young daughter. When the family doctor visits, he sees his former lover, one of the sisters. She remembers their past affair and her failed marriage with her husband, who once stabbed himself non-fatally in response to the adultery. The doctor tells her she has become more indifferent. The dying woman remembers her mother, who neglected and teased her, with greater understanding and recalls a moment of shared sorrow. While the sisters remain emotionally distant, the maid comforts the suffering woman by baring her breasts and holding her at night. The woman dies after a long period of suffering, and at her wake, the priest says her faith was stronger than his own.\n\nOne sister tells the other it is unusual for them to avoid touching each other or having a deep conversation. She tries to touch her sibling, who recoils at the gesture. The second sister recalls an earlier occasion at the mansion where, struggling with self-harm, she mutilated herself with a piece of broken glass to repel her husband. She later dines with her sister, saying the maid was devoted to the deceased and probably deserves a memento. She speaks of her own suicidal tendencies and confesses her hatred for her sister's flirtatiousness and shallow smiles. The sisters reconcile after the argument, touching each other.\n\nIn a dream sequence, the deceased briefly returns to life and asks her sisters to approach her. The first sister, repelled, says she still has life and does not love the deceased enough to join her. The second sister approaches but flees in terror when the undead woman grabs her, saying she cannot leave her husband and children. The maid re-enters the room and takes the deceased back to bed, cradling her in her arms.\n\nThe family decides to send the maid away at the end of the month, with her husband refusing additional severance pay, and she rejects her promised memento. One sister returns to her husband, and the other cannot believe her sister's claim that she does not remember their touch. The maid finds the deceased's diary with an account of a visit, describing a nostalgic moment on a swing. The deceased wrote that \"come what may, this is happiness.\""
