  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 20th century, a woman returns to her home in a wealthy neighborhood after a political rally and learns that her children have run away multiple times, causing their nanny to quit. That night, her strict husband places a newspaper advertisement for a stern nanny. The children create their own advertisement for a kind nanny, which their father dismisses. Mysteriously, a young woman floats down from the sky using an umbrella and enters their home. She introduces herself and miraculously presents the children's reconstructed advertisement. She convinces the father to hire her by promising to be firm with the children.\n\nThe new nanny helps the children magically clean their nursery and takes them on magical adventures with her street painter friend. They enter a magical drawing, ride a carousel, and participate in playful activities. The nanny uses a nonsensical word to celebrate her achievements. They visit her eccentric uncle who uncontrollably laughs and floats in the air.\n\nAt the father's workplace, a conflict erupts when the children interact with his elderly boss. The boss tries to take the child's money, causing a bank panic. The children get lost and are escorted home by the street painter, who is also working as a chimney sweep. The father is summoned to a meeting about the incident.\n\nEncouraged to connect with his children, the father attempts to make amends. He is initially fired from his job but unexpectedly rehired after telling a humorous joke that causes his boss to laugh so hard he dies. The nanny, feeling her work is complete, prepares to leave. The family goes to fly a kite together, symbolizing their newfound unity. As the nanny departs, her chimney sweep friend bids her a fond farewell."
