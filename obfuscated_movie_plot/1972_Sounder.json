The oldest son is a bright boy who loves to hunt with his father, but is only able to attend school sporadically while helping his mother on the farm. One evening, after losing their hunting prey, the family struggles with food, but manages. After a community baseball game, the sheriff arrests the father for stealing food. During the arrest, the family's dog is shot and runs away injured. The boy searches for the dog but must help his mother farm and care for his younger siblings. The mother remains hopeful the dog will return. The father is sentenced to hard labor and sent to a distant prison camp. Only the son is allowed to visit, bringing a cake baked by his mother. A sympathetic local woman who employs his mother helps the family learn the location of the prison camp. The injured dog returns home, changed. The son travels on foot to find his father at the prison camp but is unsuccessful and is violently turned away by guards. During his journey, he encounters a school for Black students and meets a compassionate teacher who cares for him, shares books, and introduces him to African-American historical literature. When the father returns home early due to a work injury, he insists the son pursue education despite the family's economic hardship. The family sees the son off to school, hopeful for his future, with their loyal dog by his side."
