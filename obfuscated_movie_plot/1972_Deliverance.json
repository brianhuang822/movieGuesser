  "obfuscated_plot": "Four businessmen from a large southern city decide to canoe down a remote river in the wilderness before it is dammed. The leader is an avid outdoorsman and survivalist, while the others are less experienced. En route to their launch site, they are rude to locals, who are hostile to the \"city boys\". At a local gas station, one of the men engages a young local in a musical duel, which is mutually enjoyable but tense.\n\nThe group travels in two canoes and becomes separated. Two of the men encounter a pair of hostile local men in the woods. One of them is brutally raped at gunpoint while the other is tied to a tree. The group's leader intervenes and kills the attacker, with the other group members helping to hide the body.\n\nThey continue downriver, but during a dangerous rapids section, one of the men falls into the water. The canoes crash, and the remaining men are thrown into the river. The leader suffers a broken thigh bone. Believing the fallen man was shot, they suspect another local man is stalking them.\n\nOne of the men climbs to a high point and shoots another man he believes is pursuing them. He discovers the man is wearing dentures and worries he might have killed an innocent person. The group weighs down the body in the river and does the same with their fallen companion's body.\n\nThey reach a small town and take the injured leader to the hospital. They carefully construct a cover story for local authorities, lying about the events to avoid murder charges. The local sheriff is suspicious but lacks evidence to arrest them. The men vow to keep their secret.\n\nThe survivor returns home to his family, haunted by nightmares of their traumatic experience, with a final image of a bloated hand rising from a lake symbolizing their unresolved guilt."
