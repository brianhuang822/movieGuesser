Dazzled by a train scene, the boy asks for a model set, which he crashes late one night. His mother allows him to film the crash using a home movie camera. The boy begins filming regularly, sometimes involving his sisters. His father receives a job offer, and the family moves to a southwestern city. His father's best friend and business partner also moves with them.\n\nYears later, the teenage boy makes films with his friends in the Boy Scouts and earns a photography badge. During a family camping trip, he films their vacation. After his grandmother's death, his father asks him to make a vacation film to cheer up his grieving mother. That night, the boy's uncle, a former circus performer, visits and shares wisdom about art and family.\n\nWhile editing the vacation footage, the boy discovers evidence of his mother's affair with his father's best friend. This creates tension in the family. Shortly after, the family moves again, and the best friend gives the boy a camera before leaving. At his new school, the boy faces antisemitic bullying and begins dating a Christian girl.\n\nHis parents announce their divorce, and at his high school prom, his girlfriend breaks up with him after he declares his love and proposes they go to Hollywood together. He creates a film about a school beach day that gains popularity among his peers, surprisingly glorifying a bully and humiliating another student.\n\nThe following year, the boy lives with his father in a major entertainment city. Struggling to find work in filmmaking, he receives an opportunity through a television show. During this time, he meets a legendary film director who offers him advice about visual composition, inspiring him to pursue his passion."
