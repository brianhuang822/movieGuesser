  "obfuscated_plot": "In a European colony in the late 17th century, a skilled doctor is arrested for treating a wounded rebel and convicted of treason. Sentenced to death, he is instead transported to a tropical colony to be sold into slavery. Purchased by a military commander's niece, the doctor becomes the colony's physician. Despite his initial resentment, he develops an escape plan with fellow prisoners.\n\nWhen a foreign naval ship attacks the colony, the doctor and his companions seize the vessel and turn to piracy. They quickly become renowned among maritime outlaws, with the doctor emerging as their most celebrated captain. Years later, the military commander becomes the colony's governor and sends his niece away.\n\nUpon her return, her ship is captured by a treacherous pirate partner. The doctor purchases her and her companion, killing the rival captain in a duel. Though she initially rejects him, he decides to return her to the colony, risking his own safety.\n\nApproaching the colony, they discover foreign warships attacking an undefended city. A royal emissary reveals a political revolution has occurred, offering the pirates full pardons and military commissions. Motivated by this opportunity, they engage the enemy ships in a fierce battle.\n\nAfter defeating the foreign vessels and saving the colony, the doctor is appointed as the new governor. The military commander's niece declares her love for him, and he dramatically confronts her uncle, revealing a surprising familial connection."
