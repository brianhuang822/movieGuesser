  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 19th century in a western territory, two outlaws are the leaders of a notorious gang. The charismatic leader and his quiet, skilled partner return to their hideout to find the gang has selected a new leader who challenges them to a leadership fight. After winning through trickery, they plan a train robbery. The first robbery is successful, and they celebrate in a nearby town. The gang's marksman visits his lover, a schoolteacher, and the leader joins them, enjoying a new bicycle. During the second train robbery, an accidental over-explosion of dynamite scatters money everywhere, and a professional law enforcement team begins pursuing them. \n\nPursued relentlessly by trackers and lawmen, the two outlaws escape by jumping from a high cliff into a river. They learn that a wealthy railroad executive has paid the posse to hunt them down until killed. They decide to flee to a South American country, hoping to find new opportunities for their criminal activities. \n\nIn this new country, they struggle with the language and local conditions but eventually become successful bank robbers with the schoolteacher's help. Their confidence wavers when they spot a lawman who reminds them of their previous pursuers. They attempt to go straight by becoming payroll guards but are ambushed by local bandits, killing their first victims. \n\nRealizing the honest life isn't for them, the schoolteacher returns home, while the two outlaws continue their criminal ways. In a final confrontation, they are cornered in a small town after stealing a payroll. Wounded and desperate, they make a last stand against local police and military forces, charging out guns blazing into an overwhelming number of opponents, with their ultimate fate left unresolved."
