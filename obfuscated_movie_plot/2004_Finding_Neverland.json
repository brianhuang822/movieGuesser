  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1900s, following the poor reception of his latest play, a struggling playwright meets a widowed woman and her four young sons in a city park. A strong friendship develops among them. The playwright proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas that he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, in particular one named after a troubled young boy. Although the playwright sees this family as wonderful and inspirational, others question his relationship with the family. The playwright's wife divorces him and the woman's mother objects to the time that he spends with the family. The mother also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as the woman weakens from an unidentified illness. A theater producer agrees to mount the play, despite his belief that it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. The playwright peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults react to their delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success. The playwright is all set for his play, but when one son arrives alone, he goes to the woman's house to check up on her and misses the show. The son attends the play and realizes it is really about his brothers and the playwright. The playwright arranges to have an abridged production performed in the family's house. At the end of the play, a character points to the back doors and implies that the woman should go off to an imaginary place. She takes the hands of her boys and slowly walks out. The following scene takes place at the woman's funeral. The playwright discovers that her will says that he and her mother should look after the boys, an arrangement agreeable to both parties. The story ends with the playwright comforting the son on the bench in the park where they had first met."
