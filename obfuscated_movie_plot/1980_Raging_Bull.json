  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1940s, a young up-and-coming middleweight boxer suffers his first loss after a controversial decision. His brother discusses a potential championship shot with a local mob connection, repeatedly refusing criminal assistance to win on his own terms. The boxer spots a teenage girl at a local swimming pool and pursues a relationship with her, despite being married and her being underage.\n\nBy the mid-1940s, he marries the young woman but is controlling and jealous, constantly suspicious of her fidelity. His professional boxing career involves brutal fights and strategic negotiations with local organized crime figures. He purposely loses a match to gain favor with mob leadership, which temporarily impacts his boxing status.\n\nHe eventually wins the middleweight championship, but his personal life becomes increasingly volatile. Consumed by paranoia, he accuses his wife of multiple affairs and violently confronts his own brother, assaulting him and briefly knocking his wife unconscious. Their relationship remains tumultuous but intermittently reconciled.\n\nHis boxing career declines, and he ultimately loses his championship title. By the mid-1950s, he has retired and moved to a southern city. After staying out all night at his nightclub, his wife demands a divorce and threatens legal action. He is arrested for admitting underage girls to his establishment and unsuccessfully tries bribing his way out of criminal charges.\n\nAfter serving jail time, he encounters his estranged brother and attempts reconciliation. In the 1960s, he performs stand-up comedy, preparing for shows by shadowboxing and quoting dramatic film scenes."
