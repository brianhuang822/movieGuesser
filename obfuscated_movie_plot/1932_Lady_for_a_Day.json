  "obfuscated_plot": "A story centers on an aging, impoverished fruit seller in a large city, whose daughter was raised in a foreign convent since infancy. The daughter believes her mother is a wealthy socialite living in an upscale hotel. The fruit seller discovers her deception might be exposed when her daughter arrives with her fiancé and his father. Among her supporters is a gambling gangster who believes her fruit brings him luck, along with his henchman. Her street friends convince the gangster to help her maintain her fabricated social status. His nightclub-owning girlfriend helps transform the fruit seller from a street peddler to an elegant woman. The gangster arranges for a pool hustler to pose as her sophisticated second husband. At the pier, she tearfully reunites with her daughter, elegantly dressed. When society reporters become suspicious about her invented background, they are kidnapped by the gangster's associates, causing a media uproar. The fake husband announces a grand reception for the daughter, her fiancé, and his father, enlisting the gangster's friends to pose as high-society guests. On the night of the event, police surround the nightclub, believing the gangster responsible for the missing reporters. Just as the fruit seller is about to confess the truth, unexpected political intervention allows her to maintain her charade and preserve her daughter's perception of her social standing before she sails away with her future husband."
