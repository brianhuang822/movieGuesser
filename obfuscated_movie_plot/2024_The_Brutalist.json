  "obfuscated_plot": "A Holocaust survivor and architect immigrates to a large city after being forcibly separated from his wife and orphaned niece. As his ship enters the harbor, he sees a famous landmark. In the late 1940s, he travels to another city and stays with his cousin. He discovers his wife and niece are alive but stuck in Europe. His cousin offers him work, and they are approached by a wealthy industrialist's son about a renovation project. After a failed project, the cousin blames the protagonist and kicks him out.\n\nThree years later, the protagonist is a heroin addict working as a laborer and living with an African-American single father friend. The industrialist unexpectedly recognizes the protagonist's architectural talents and commissions a grand community center project. The protagonist begins working, employing his friend, and soon reunites with his wife and niece.\n\nDuring construction, he clashes with contractors and faces various challenges. The project is temporarily abandoned, but later restarted. The industrialist sexually assaults the protagonist during a marble-purchasing trip, traumatizing him. His wife confronts the industrialist's family about the assault.\n\nIn later years, a retrospective of the protagonist's work is held at an international architecture exhibition. His niece gives a speech revealing that the community center's design was a profound meditation on trauma, with architectural elements referencing concentration camps. She concludes with a meaningful phrase about destinations over journeys, suggesting the protagonist's complex response to his life experiences."
