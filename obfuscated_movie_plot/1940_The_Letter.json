  "obfuscated_plot": "A wife of a plantation manager in a tropical colony shoots dead a well-known member of the expatriate community. She tells her servant to send for the district officer and her husband, who is loading goods for shipment. Her husband returns with his attorney, a close family friend. The wife claims she killed the man to save her honor.\n\nShe is placed under arrest, jailed in a nearby city, and charged with murder. Her eventual acquittal seems certain, as her community believes her story and feels she acted heroically. Only the attorney harbors suspicion. His clerk reveals a letter exists that she wrote to the victim the day of the shooting, imploring him to come while her husband was away. The clerk shows a copy revealing her clear culpability in her ex-lover's murder and conveys that the original is for sale at a high price.\n\nThe attorney confronts the wife, who eventually confesses to writing the letter. She manipulates him into agreeing to buy it back despite the risk to his career. He tells her husband about the letter without revealing its content or true price, which will exhaust nearly all of the husband's savings. The clerk arranges for the wife to personally retrieve the letter from the victim's widow in an ethnic neighborhood.\n\nShe is acquitted. Afterward, her husband announces plans to buy a plantation in another region to give them a fresh start. The attorney reveals the true cost of the letter, which devastates the husband upon learning of his wife's long-standing infidelity.\n\nDuring a celebration, the wife discovers a dagger she recognizes from the letter retrieval. Her husband offers forgiveness if she swears her love, but she instead confesses her continued love for the murdered man. As she walks into the garden, she is grabbed by her own servant while the victim's widow stabs her with the dagger. The two murderers are immediately caught by a passing policeman."
