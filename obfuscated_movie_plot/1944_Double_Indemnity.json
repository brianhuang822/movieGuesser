  "obfuscated_plot": "An injured insurance salesman stumbles into his empty office late at night and begins recording a dictaphone confession for his claims manager. One year earlier, he flirts with a married woman during a house call about her husband's automobile insurance. She inquires about obtaining a life insurance policy without her husband's knowledge. Deducing her murderous intent, the salesman is initially reluctant but becomes fascinated and tempted to outsmart the insurance company.\n\nThe woman visits his apartment, and together they devise a plan to trick her husband into signing a life insurance policy, murder him, and stage his death as an accident to trigger a higher payout. The husband unknowingly signs the policy, believing it to be an automotive insurance renewal. An unexpected leg injury complicates their scheme, but they proceed with the murder.\n\nThe salesman hides in the woman's car, kills her husband at a train station by breaking his neck, and then boards the train impersonating the dead man using a fake leg cast. After carefully avoiding detection by other passengers, he stages the body on train tracks and escapes.\n\nThe claims manager becomes suspicious of the death, meticulously investigating the circumstances. The salesman befriends the victim's stepdaughter, who shares her own suspicions about the woman's previous manipulative behavior. Gradually, the salesman realizes the full extent of the woman's deceptive nature.\n\nAs the investigation intensifies, the woman begins seeing the stepdaughter's boyfriend, potentially planning to manipulate him. The salesman confronts the woman, threatening her. In a dramatic moment, she shoots him, but ultimately cannot complete the act. They embrace, and he shoots her with her own gun.\n\nThe salesman completes his confession, and the claims manager discovers him bleeding. Knowing he won't escape, the salesman accepts his fate. Their final exchange reveals a deep, complicated friendship, with the claims manager suggesting the salesman was always too close to see the truth. The story ends with the salesman dying in the doorway, awaiting police and medical assistance."
