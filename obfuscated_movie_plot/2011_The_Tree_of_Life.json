  "obfuscated_plot": "A family drama spanning several decades follows a middle-class suburban family in mid-20th century America. The story primarily centers on a father, a frustrated engineer with musical aspirations, and a mother who embodies gentleness and spiritual grace. They have three sons, with the eldest named John becoming the primary narrative focus.\n\nThe family's life is marked by tension between the father's stern discipline and the mother's nurturing approach. As John grows up, he struggles with his father's harsh parenting and begins to rebel, committing petty crimes and experiencing emotional turmoil. A pivotal moment occurs when the family must relocate after the father loses his job.\n\nIn later life, John becomes a successful but emotionally disconnected architect. He is haunted by the early death of his younger brother at age 19 and maintains a difficult relationship with his aging father.\n\nThe narrative is interspersed with philosophical and metaphysical sequences, including dreamlike representations of universal creation, evolutionary moments, and cosmic processes. These sequences explore themes of nature, grace, suffering, and interconnectedness.\n\nThe film culminates in a transcendent finale where John experiences a spiritual vision. He sees deceased family members reunited in an ethereal landscape, symbolizing reconciliation and peace. His deceased brother is returned to their parents, and his mother symbolically releases her son to a higher plane of existence.\n\nThe story ultimately presents a meditative exploration of family dynamics, personal growth, loss, forgiveness, and the human experience within the broader context of universal existence."
