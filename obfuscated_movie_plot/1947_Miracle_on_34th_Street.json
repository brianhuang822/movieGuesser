  "obfuscated_plot": "During a holiday parade, the man playing Santa is intoxicated. An elderly gentleman complains to the event director, a woman named Sarah. She convinces him to play Santa in the parade. After success, he is hired to play Santa at a department store in a large city. The toy department head instructs him to recommend overstocked items, but instead, he helps a mother find a rare toy for her son at another store. An attorney named John, who is Sarah's neighbor, brings her young daughter Susan to see Santa. After hearing the man speak a foreign language to an orphan girl, Susan is amazed. Sarah, who has raised Susan to be pragmatic, asks Santa to tell her the truth, but he insists he is the real Santa Claus.\n\nWorried, Sarah considers firing him, but the store owner promises bonuses due to positive publicity. A company psychologist suggests evaluating Santa's mental state and eventually recommends institutionalizing him. Susan shows Santa a picture of her dream house, which he promises to help her get. After a confrontation where Santa strikes the psychologist with an umbrella, he is committed to a hospital.\n\nThe attorney represents Santa in court, where a dramatic hearing ensues about Santa's existence. Through clever legal maneuvering, including testimony from the store owner and the district attorney's own son, they create uncertainty. A postal worker's decision to deliver letters addressed to Santa to the courthouse becomes a pivotal moment. The judge dismisses the case, effectively validating Santa's identity.\n\nDuring a Christmas celebration, Susan initially loses faith when Santa cannot get her exact house. However, she discovers her dream house is suddenly for sale. The attorney and Sarah decide to marry and purchase the house, noticing a mysterious cane that suggests Santa might indeed be magical."
