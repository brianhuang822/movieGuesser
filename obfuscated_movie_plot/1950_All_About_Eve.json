The newcomer claims to have followed the star's theatrical tour after seeing her perform, sharing a heartbreaking story of her impoverished childhood and lost husband during a war. Moved by her tale, the star takes her in as an assistant.\n\nThe newcomer quickly manipulates her way into the star's life, becoming both her secretary and an obsessive admirer. The star is simultaneously concerned about her romantic relationship with a younger film director. Without the star's knowledge, the newcomer orchestrates a calculated late-night phone call designed to create tension in the couple's relationship.\n\nHoping to advance her own career, the newcomer conspires with the playwright's wife to have an opportunity to perform. She secretly invites theater critics to witness her performance, which becomes a triumphant debut. She attempts to seduce the film director, who rejects her advances.\n\nA critical newspaper article criticizes the star and subtly promotes the newcomer.
