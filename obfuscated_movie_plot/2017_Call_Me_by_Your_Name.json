  "obfuscated_plot": "In the summer of a certain year in the 1980s, a teenage boy lives with his parents in a picturesque rural region of a European country. The boy's father, an academic in archaeology, invites a graduate student to live with the family over the summer and assist with academic paperwork. The teenage boy, an introspective and artistic youth, initially believes he has little in common with the older student, who appears confident and carefree. The teenager spends much of the summer reading, playing music, and socializing with childhood friends. During a casual sporting event, the older student touches the teenager's back, but the teenager initially dismisses the interaction. The teenager later feels jealous upon seeing the student kissing one of his female friends. \n\nThe two begin spending more time together, taking long walks and accompanying the father on a work expedition. The teenager becomes increasingly attracted to the student, even secretly exploring the student's personal space. Eventually, the teenager confesses his feelings, leading to a complex and intimate relationship. They share romantic encounters, with the teenager also experiencing a brief sexual relationship with a female friend. \n\nAs the student's stay nears its end, the parents, seemingly aware of the deep bond between the two, suggest they take a short trip together. They spend several romantic days together before the student must return home. The teenager is devastated by the separation. His parents, particularly his father, offer compassionate understanding about the profound nature of his emotional experience.\n\nLater, during a holiday season, the student calls to announce his engagement to a woman he has been intermittently dating. A poignant phone conversation ensues, with both acknowledging their shared memories. The teenager is left sitting by a fireplace, reflecting tearfully on their intense summer relationship as his family prepares dinner."
