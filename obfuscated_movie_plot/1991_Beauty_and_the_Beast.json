  "obfuscated_plot": "A magical woman disguised as an old beggar arrives at a castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince an enchanted flower in exchange for shelter from a storm. When he scornfully declines, she reveals her true form and transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects as punishment for his cruelty. To break the curse, the prince must learn to love someone and gain that person's love before the last petal of the flower falls on his 21st birthday; otherwise, he will remain a beast forever. Several years later, in a nearby village, a bookworm daughter of an eccentric inventor dreams of adventure while constantly rejecting advances from an arrogant hunter. One day, the inventor travels to a local fair to present his latest invention, a wood-chopping machine, but becomes lost in the forest. Upon seeking refuge in the Beast's castle, he is eventually detained for trespassing. After the daughter finds her father locked in the castle dungeon, she offers to take his place as a prisoner; the Beast agrees, though her father does not. She meets the castle's servants, including a candelabra who believes that she has come to undo the spell, a mantel clock, a teapot, and her son, a small teacup. When she finds the enchanted flower, the Beast angrily forces her to flee outside. Wolves ambush her, and the Beast rescues her, getting injured in the process. As she nurses his wounds, they develop a rapport. In the village, her father fails to convince the townsfolk of the Beast. Hearing the father's statements, the hunter bribes the warden of the local insane asylum to have the father declared insane and locked up, which the hunter will use to blackmail the daughter into marrying him in exchange for her father's release. Before they can act, the father leaves to attempt a rescue alone. The daughter discovers her father's predicament via a magic mirror. Out of his love for her, the Beast releases her to rescue him. Returning to town, she reveals the Beast via the mirror, shocking the townsfolk and proving her father's sanity. Realizing she has fallen for the Beast, the hunter jealously has her thrown into the cellar with her father and rallies the villagers to kill the Beast. The teacup, who stowed away when she left, frees the two with the inventor's machine. As the castle's servants defeat the villagers, the hunter attacks the depressed Beast, who regains his spirit upon seeing the daughter return and spares the hunter's life, but the hunter fatally stabs him before losing his footing and falling to his demise. The daughter tearfully professes her love to a dying Beast as the last petal falls, which undoes the curse, reviving the Beast, restoring him and his servants to their human forms, and restoring the castle to its true appearance. The prince and the daughter later host a ball for the kingdom."
