The reporter's first assignment is to interview a foreign diplomat at a luncheon. The reporter shares a cab with the diplomat and becomes smitten with the host's daughter at the event. The host, a leader of a peace organization, announces the diplomat has fallen ill and his daughter will speak instead.\n\nThe newspaper sends the reporter to another city to cover the diplomat's next appearance. During this event, a photographer assassinates the diplomat. The reporter, the daughter, and another reporter chase the assassin. They discover the murdered diplomat was an imposter, and the real diplomat is alive but drugged.\n\nAfter several narrow escapes from spies and attempted kidnappings, the reporter and the daughter board a ship where they become engaged. In another country, they uncover a conspiracy involving the daughter's father, who is secretly working with international spies. They learn the spies are torturing the diplomat to extract a secret treaty clause.\n\nThe reporter and his colleague rescue the diplomat. As war is declared, they pursue the conspirators on an aircraft. During the journey, the daughter's father realizes he will be exposed as a traitor. He confesses to his daughter and ultimately sacrifices himself when the aircraft is attacked, allowing the others to survive.\n\nAn American ship rescues the survivors. Despite being prevented from filing their story due to neutrality, they secretly communicate the information. The reporter becomes a successful war correspondent, broadcasting reports about the bombing of a major city and urging support for the war effort."
