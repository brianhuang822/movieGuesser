  "obfuscated_plot": "A foreign noble is taken captive during a religious war by a rival duke while returning home. The noble's treacherous brother, aided by a fellow noble, names himself regent of the region, increasing taxes on the local population under the pretense of gathering a ransom. The ruling class exploits and oppresses the local people. A noble from the oppressed group opposes the brutality and rescues a commoner from execution, earning the ruling noble's anger. He later confronts the regent at a castle banquet, declaring his actions treason. The regent orders his execution, but he escapes into a nearby forest with two companions. The regent seizes his lands and declares him an outlaw. \n\nThe noble and his companions recruit more men, forming a band that swears to fight injustice and help the poor. They wage a guerrilla war against the corrupt rulers, capturing tax collectors and exposing their cruelty. A rotund religious figure joins their group and helps in their missions. \n\nDuring one of their raids, they capture a noble woman who initially disdains them but comes to support their cause after witnessing the ruling class's brutality. The local sheriff attempts to trap the noble hero by hosting an archery tournament, but the hero is ultimately captured and sentenced to death. The noble woman helps plan his rescue.\n\nThe rightful ruler returns in disguise, with a plot against him orchestrated by the regent. The noble woman discovers this plot and is herself sentenced to death. Her servant helps warn the hero, who kills the assassin sent to eliminate the returning ruler.\n\nThe rightful ruler reveals himself, and a massive battle erupts in the castle. The hero defeats the primary antagonist, saves the noble woman, and forces the surrender of the regent's forces. The ruler restores the hero's lands and title, banishes the corrupt officials, and commands the hero to marry the noble woman."
