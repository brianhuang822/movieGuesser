  "obfuscated_plot": "A wealthy businessman is murdered. The police initially suspect the victim's wife's first husband, who owns the murder weapon and appears to have a motive. The wife protests and tells her story through a series of flashbacks. \n\nHer initial marriage is unhappy, and after separating from her husband, she becomes a single mother to two daughters - a teenage social climber and a younger tomboyish child. To support her family, she begins baking and working as a waitress, hiding her secondary job from her status-obsessed older daughter. \n\nThe mother meets a charming, financially struggling socialite who owns a property she wants to purchase for her restaurant. They eventually marry, with the socialite receiving a business stake in exchange. Her daughter moves into the socialite's mansion, seemingly reconciling with her mother.\n\nThe younger child dies from illness, which drives the mother to work even harder. She builds a successful restaurant chain with help from a friend and business associate. Her daughter secretly marries for money, then schemes to extract more funds through a fake pregnancy.\n\nEventually, the daughter becomes romantically involved with her mother's husband. When he rejects her, she murders him using her mother's gun. She then manipulates her mother into helping her cover up the crime. The mother attempts to frame another man for the murder.\n\nThe police reveal they always knew the daughter was the true murderer. The daughter is arrested, seemingly unrepentant, while the mother is left devastated but still connected to her first husband."
