  "obfuscated_plot": "A military officer on the way to a slave auction helps recapture a defiant slave. At the auction site, he is reunited with his childhood love, who is a ward of the emperor and pledged in marriage to a regent. The officer has a longstanding feud with the regent and outbids him for the slave, who becomes his personal servant. The regent vengefully transfers the officer to a distant province. His love interest promises to appeal on his behalf, and they pledge their love. \n\nArriving in a distant region, the officer is present on the same day a religious figure enters a city, hailed as a spiritual leader. The slave feels compelled to follow this figure and attempts to warn him of a plot. The regional governor assigns the officer to handle an execution, which includes the religious figure. During the execution, the officer wins the religious figure's robe in a dice game. When he uses the robe, he experiences intense pain. The slave denounces the empire and leaves.\n\nHaunted by nightmares, the officer is commissioned by the emperor to find and destroy the robe and identify the religious figure's followers. He travels to a town where people believe the religious figure performed miracles and rose from death. He confronts his former slave, who suggests the robe's power is actually the officer's guilt. When attempting to destroy the robe, he is unexpectedly healed.\n\nAfter a series of conflicts and missions, the officer confesses his role in the religious figure's death and pledges his life to the figure's teachings. His love interest stands with him when he is put on trial for his beliefs, and they are condemned to death together. As they are led away, they are united in their faith, choosing spiritual commitment over earthly allegiance."
