  "obfuscated_plot": "In the early 1900s, during a vibrant era at the turn of the century, a wealthy older gentleman remarks that in a major European city, marriage is not the sole option for young men of leisure. A bored young socialite enjoys spending time with an elderly woman and her granddaughter, a precocious young girl. Following family tradition, the grandmother regularly sends the girl to her sister to be groomed as a potential mistress to wealthy men.\n\nThe young girl learns etiquette but disdains the superficial relationships of high society. She enjoys spending time with the young socialite, whom she views like an older brother. The man is known for his womanizing ways in the city's elite circles. After a public scandal with a former mistress, he continues his social life.\n\nDuring a card game, the girl wins a bet to take a weekend trip to a seaside town. While there, the older generation reminisces about a past romantic relationship. The girl's grandmother and great-aunt scheme to prepare her to become the socialite's mistress. When he returns, he notices the girl's transformation and is conflicted.\n\nAfter initial tension, the socialite realizes he has romantic feelings for the girl. He proposes a formal arrangement to her family, but she initially refuses, not wanting to become just another mistress. Eventually, she agrees, understanding she would rather be with him than without him.\n\nAt an elegant restaurant, the girl performs perfectly as his companion, which unexpectedly disturbs the socialite. Feeling uncomfortable with societal expectations, he becomes increasingly agitated. His uncle congratulates him, but the comment disgusts the socialite.\n\nOverwhelmed, he takes the girl home in tears and wanders the city streets. Ultimately, he returns and asks her grandmother for the girl's hand in marriage. The story concludes with the couple elegantly departing together, now happily married."
