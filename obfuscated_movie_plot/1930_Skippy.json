  "obfuscated_plot": "A young boy is the spirited son of a strict doctor and his wife who live in a small Midwestern town. The doctor forbids his son to play in the impoverished shantytown area because of its filth and criminal surroundings. Regardless, the boy and his friend visit the shantytown, where the boy meets a new kid. He saves the new kid from a bully, and the two become friends. One day, the bully accidentally breaks his father's windshield with the boy's toy. The bully, whose father is brutish and aggressive, blames the damage on the two boys. The bully's father, who works as a dogcatcher, takes the new kid's dog and demands the two boys pay for the damages if they want their dog back. The boys gather three dollars by breaking the first boy's savings bank, but the dogcatcher accepts it only for his windshield. He gives them three days to obtain another three dollars for a dog license, and he threatens to kill their dog if they don't get him the money. The two boys spend the next two days selling bottles, lemonade and wood, and staging a performance to earn money, but the first boy's father doesn't want to lend them the remaining thirty cents. The dogcatcher kills the dog and the boy blames his father. The next morning, the boy gets a new bicycle from his father but trades it to a friend for her new dog. He then takes the dog to his friend. The doctor has a change of heart and buys the second boy a licensed dog, finds his mother a job, and refrains from ordering the shantytown destroyed, instead offering assistance to its citizens. For the first time, the doctor plays with his son in the shantytown. There they accidentally break the dogcatcher's new windshield. The doctor wins a fight against the dogcatcher and shows he is a good father."
