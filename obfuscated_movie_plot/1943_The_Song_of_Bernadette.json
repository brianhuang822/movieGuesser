  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-19th century, a 14-year-old girl lives in poverty with her family in a small rural village. She is shamed by her religious school teacher for falling behind in her studies because of her illness. One afternoon, while gathering firewood with her sister and a friend, she waits alone in a local grotto. Distracted by a strange breeze and changing light, she sees a beautiful lady dressed in white, standing on a rock niche. She tells her companions what she saw, and they promise to keep it secret. However, her sister tells their mother, and the story soon spreads throughout the village. Many, including her aunt, are convinced of her sincerity, supporting her against her disbelieving parents. She continues to repeatedly visit the grotto as requested by the lady, accompanied by other villagers.\n\nWhile the local priest initially refuses to get involved, civil authorities threateningly interrogate her, but she confounds them with her simplicity and stands behind her story. On one visit, the lady asks her to drink and wash at a seemingly nonexistent spring. She obediently digs a hole in the ground and smears her face with dirt. Though initially ridiculed, water later begins to flow, which exhibits miraculous healing properties; ailing people soon begin flocking to the location.\n\nOn her last visit to the grotto, the lady finally identifies herself. When civil authorities try to have her declared insane, the local priest, who once doubted her, becomes her staunchest ally and asks for a formal church investigation. After years of questioning and examination, the commission ultimately determines that she truly experienced the visions.\n\nBelieving it unsuitable for her to live an ordinary life, the priest persuades her to join a religious order. She undergoes rigorous spiritual training and works hard at the convent but is also subjected to emotional abuse from her former teacher, now a senior nun. Despite enduring harsh treatment, she reveals a hidden tumor, showing she has been suffering from a severe illness without complaint.\n\nOn her deathbed, she sends for the priest and confesses her feelings of unworthiness. In her final moments, she experiences a vision of the lady, who smiles and gestures warmly. She joyfully acknowledges the apparition before dying. Upon her death, the priest remarks about her transcendent nature and spiritual significance."
