  "obfuscated_plot": "An elderly man is arrested for walking on a highway. His son picks him up and learns that the man believes he has won a sweepstakes prize. Despite his family's disbelief that it's a scam, the man insists on traveling to collect the money to buy a truck and an air compressor. His son agrees to drive him, partly to spend time with him and give his wife a break. The other son is reluctant, viewing his father as a neglectful alcoholic.\n\nDuring the road trip, the father goes on a drinking binge and injures himself, requiring a hospital stay. They stop in the father's hometown, where the son meets his father's former business partner who had stolen an air compressor years ago. News of the supposed prize money spreads quickly through the small town.\n\nThe rest of the family arrives, and tensions rise as relatives demand money they believe is owed to them. A confrontation erupts, which the mother stops by calling out the relatives' own unpaid debts. The family tours the father's abandoned childhood home, where he shares memories, including witnessing a sibling's death.\n\nThe former business partner attempts to blackmail the father by revealing past infidelity. The father's nephews steal the prize letter and discard it after confirming it's a scam. The son confronts the former business partner physically.\n\nThe father reveals he wants the money to leave something for his sons after his death. Despite learning he didn't win, the son trades his car for a truck and buys an air compressor. On the return trip, he allows his father to drive through town, symbolically restoring his father's dignity in front of those who had disrespected him."
