  "obfuscated_plot": "In a future time of severe environmental degradation, a powerful corporation mines a valuable mineral on a distant moon inhabited by a tall, blue-skinned indigenous species living in ecological harmony. Humans use genetically engineered hybrid bodies to explore the planet's hostile environment. A disabled veteran is recruited to infiltrate the native population through one of these hybrid bodies, initially as a corporate spy.\n\nAfter being rescued by a native princess during a dangerous encounter in the forest, he is reluctantly accepted into her clan. The corporate leadership wants him to gather intelligence about the natives' sacred gathering place, which sits atop a rich mineral deposit. As he learns their ways, he falls in love with the princess and becomes integrated into their society.\n\nWhen the corporation decides to destroy the natives' massive central dwelling to extract minerals, the protagonist attempts to prevent this. After his true mission is revealed, he is initially rejected by the tribe. The corporate forces brutally destroy the natives' home, killing many including the princess's father.\n\nThe protagonist regains the natives' trust by performing a legendary spiritual feat involving a feared mythical creature. He then unites multiple tribal groups to resist the corporate invasion. During a massive battle, the planet's wildlife unexpectedly joins the fight, overwhelming the human forces.\n\nIn a final confrontation, the corporate military leader tries to kill the protagonist, but is defeated by the princess. Afterward, most of the human invaders are expelled from the planet, and the protagonist permanently transforms into a member of the native species, integrated fully into their society and culture."
