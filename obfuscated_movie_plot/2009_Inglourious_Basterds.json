  "obfuscated_plot": "During a war in the 1940s, a ruthless military officer interrogates a rural farmer about a fugitive family, massacring them but allowing a young woman to escape. Three years later, an army lieutenant recruits a special commando unit of soldiers to terrorize enemy forces in an occupied country. The young woman, now running a cinema in a major city, becomes involved with a famous enemy soldier who arranges a film premiere at her theater. She secretly plots with her lover to kill enemy leadership by burning down the cinema using highly flammable film reels.\n\nA specialized team of commandos attempts to infiltrate the premiere, but a covert meeting in a local tavern goes wrong, resulting in a deadly shootout. The team's leader negotiates to continue the mission by disguising themselves as foreign filmmakers. A high-ranking military officer discovers their plot and betrays the undercover agent.\n\nDuring the film premiere, multiple plot lines converge. The young woman and the enemy soldier kill each other in the projection booth. Simultaneously, her lover locks the auditorium and sets the theater on fire. Other commandos break into a private box and assassinate top enemy leadership.\n\nThe military officer negotiates a deal to surrender to the allied forces, but the commando unit's leader ultimately marks the officer as a war criminal by carving a distinctive symbol into his forehead, declaring it his ultimate triumph."
