  "obfuscated_plot": "The story is told in three main story arcs, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at holiday parties, held at a prestigious hotel, hosted by a woman and her husband. The woman serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events connect to her. Her husband becomes infatuated with her sister and eventually begins an affair with her. He attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength. The sister has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, who is much older. She finds her relationship with him no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) his professed interest in continuing to teach her. She leaves him after admitting to having a dalliance with her sister's husband.\n\nFor the remainder of the year between the first and second holiday gatherings, the husband and sister carry on their affair despite his inability to end his marriage. The sister finally ends the affair during the second holiday, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.\n\nThe woman's ex-husband, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story. Flashbacks reveal that his marriage fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility. However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing. He also went on a disastrous date with the woman's other sister.\n\nA hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility of a brain tumor. When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless. His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion. Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing a classic comedy film. The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with the sister, which this time blossoms into love.\n\nThe sister's story is the third main arc. A former drug addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career. After borrowing money from her sibling, she starts a catering business with a friend. They end up as rivals in auditions for parts in theater productions, as well as for the affections of an architect. She abandons the catering business after the romance fails and decides to try her hand at writing.\n\nThe career change forces her once again to borrow money from her sibling, a dependency that she resents. She writes a script inspired by her sibling and brother-in-law, which greatly upsets her sibling. It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of their marriage. Although this threatens to expose the affair, her brother-in-law soon disavows disclosing any such details.\n\nBy the time of the third holiday gathering, the sister who had the affair has married a literature professor. The main couple has reconciled their marriage. The film's final shot reveals that the struggling actress is married to the television writer and is pregnant."
