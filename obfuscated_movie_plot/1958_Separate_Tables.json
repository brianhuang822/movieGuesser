  "obfuscated_plot": "In a coastal town, at a residential hotel, a retired military officer tries but fails to hide a newspaper article about himself. His attempt to keep the article from the eyes of the other guests only succeeds in heightening their awareness of it, particularly a strict elderly woman and a more compassionate older lady. The two women read in the paper that the military officer has pleaded guilty to sexually harassing several young women in a theatre. However, the filed complaints are, in themselves, questionable. The strict elderly woman wants the military officer expelled from the hotel and holds a meeting with other long-term residents to decide the issue before presenting it to the manager, a female staff member. The elderly woman leads the meeting arguing for his expulsion, and despite the opposing views of the other residents, she informs the manager that the military officer must leave.\n\nA divorced couple meets outside. The ex-wife coolly teases her former husband, informing him that she is engaged; he tells her he is engaged as well, but does not disclose that he is engaged to the hotel manager. He claims that though she could have married other men who were wealthier and more important, she chose him, a man in a lower economic class, in order to manipulate and degrade him fully. Despite this, they admit they are still attracted to each other. She asks him to come to her room.\n\nAs they walk into the hotel, the manager tells the ex-wife she has a phone call. The manager asks her former husband, knowing the dynamics between the ex-spouses, to consider the real reason for her visit. He defends her at first, claiming that all his misfortunes are his own fault, but changes his mind when the manager tells him that his ex-wife is talking on the phone to his publisher, the only person who knows that he and the manager are engaged.\n\nHe confronts his ex-wife in her bedroom. When she attempts to seduce him, he cruelly tells her that, in the light, he can see that she has aged and without her physical beauty it will be impossible for her to continue to manipulate people. She begs him to stay, but he runs out of the hotel after striking her. The ex-wife has an emotional breakdown, and the manager comforts her. She reveals that she is not really engaged and has been abusing sleeping pills to ease her pain, even during the day.\n\nThe next morning, the elderly woman's downtrodden daughter tells the military officer that she knows what he did. He explains that he has always been fearful of people and that it is easier for him to attempt to be familiar with strangers. He tells her that they get along well with each other because they are both afraid of life. As he returns to his room to pack, she worries he will not find a new home.\n\nWhen the ex-husband returns in the morning, the manager tells him that his ex-wife is emotionally unwell, and asks him to see her before she checks out of the hotel. After he leaves, the manager attempts to persuade the military officer to stay, but he refuses. When the military officer enters the dining room, there is an awkward silence until the ex-husband greets him. The others do the same and cheerfully converse with him.\n\nThe elderly woman is angered by this and demands her daughter leave with her. The daughter refuses to obey her mother's command for the first time ever, and insists on remaining to finish her breakfast. After her mother leaves, she starts to talk to the military officer, who decides to stay on at the hotel. As the hotel residents each eat their breakfast at separate tables, the ex-husband and ex-wife appear to reconcile, but they do not know if they can ever be happy, together or apart."
