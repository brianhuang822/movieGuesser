  "obfuscated_plot": "A young law enforcement trainee at a prestigious academy is recruited by her unit chief to interview a brilliant and cannibalistic imprisoned psychiatrist. Her mission is to gain insights into a serial killer who murders young women and removes their skin. At the high-security medical facility, the manipulative director makes unwelcome advances before introducing her to the psychiatrist. \n\nInitially courteous, the psychiatrist becomes dismissive but later offers a cryptic clue that leads the trainee to discover evidence related to the killer. After an inmate assaults the trainee, the psychiatrist orchestrates the assailant's death. He agrees to assist the investigation in exchange for a transfer, demanding personal information from the trainee in return for insights.\n\nThe trainee reveals a traumatic childhood incident involving her father's death and her inability to save farm animals. The psychiatrist provides a profile suggesting the killer is psychologically unstable and falsely believes himself to be something he is not. \n\nThe psychiatrist dramatically escapes custody through a gruesome plan, murdering guards and disguising himself. Meanwhile, the trainee independently investigates the killer's background, discovering he creates a \"suit\" from human skin. Her unit chief identifies the suspect through various databases.\n\nIn a tense confrontation, the trainee tracks the killer to his home. Using her training, she pursues him into a basement where she finds his latest victim. Despite the killer's attempt to use night-vision equipment, she manages to shoot and kill him, rescuing the captive.\n\nAfter graduating from the academy, the trainee receives a cryptic phone call from the psychiatrist, who is now free and hints at his next potential victim. He suggests he has no immediate plans to harm her, and she declines to engage further."
