  "obfuscated_plot": "A wealthy family dominates a Midwestern city in the late 19th century. As a young man, a local businessman courts a young woman from the prominent family, but she rejects him after a public embarrassment. Instead, she marries a passionless man and spoils their son. The townspeople hope to see the son eventually humbled.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the family hosts a party for the son, who has returned from college. The businessman, now a widower, attends and encounters the family again. The son dislikes the businessman, seeing him as a social climber, and ridicules his new technology. However, he is immediately attracted to the businessman's daughter.\n\nThe son's rudeness and arrogance gradually alienate everyone around him. His father dies, and he becomes increasingly controlling of his mother. When the businessman begins courting his mother, the son prevents their relationship, forcing his mother to choose between her love and her son. She chooses her son, sacrificing her own happiness.\n\nAs times change, the family's wealth diminishes. The son and his aunt lose their fortune through bad investments. The businessman's daughter rejects the son's marriage proposal, criticizing his lack of ambition. Eventually, the son is forced to take factory work to survive.\n\nIn a twist of fate, the son is seriously injured by a technological innovation he once mocked. In the hospital, a reconciliation occurs between the son, the businessman, and his daughter, suggesting a potential redemption and healing of past wounds."
