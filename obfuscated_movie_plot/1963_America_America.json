  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 19th century, a young man from an impoverished mountain village in a repressive empire lives under harsh conditions. He and his close friend plan to escape to a distant land of opportunity. After witnessing a brutal ethnic massacre that kills his friend, the young man is entrusted by his father to travel to the capital city and establish a better life for his family. He is given the family's entire savings to invest in a relative's business.\n\nTraveling through rural countryside, he is robbed and loses everything. Upon arriving at his relative's home, he is pressured to marry a plain woman from a wealthy merchant family to solve the relative's financial problems. Refusing initially, he becomes homeless and survives through hard labor and the help of a streetwise mentor.\n\nAfter multiple setbacks, including losing his savings to a prostitute and surviving a violent police raid, he reluctantly agrees to marry. Before the wedding, he plans to use his wife's dowry to fund his emigration. Through a fortuitous connection, he begins an affair with an older, wealthy merchant's neglected wife, who helps him purchase a passage to the new world.\n\nDuring the sea journey, he becomes entangled in a dramatic confrontation with the merchant. A terminally ill friend sacrifices himself, allowing the protagonist to assume his identity and successfully immigrate. Working menial jobs and slowly saving money, he eventually brings his entire family to their new homeland, though his father dies before experiencing the same opportunity."
