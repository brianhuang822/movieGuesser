  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-20th century, an aging classical music conductor plays a musical sequence on a piano while being interviewed in his home. After finishing, he shares brief details about the significant impact left by his wife and mentions seeing her ghost. In the early 1940s, the young assistant conductor makes his conducting debut at short notice when the guest conductor falls ill. His exceptional performance receives a rapturous reception from the audience and catapults him to fame. Despite being in an intermittent relationship with a fellow musician, he falls for an aspiring actress at a party and the two begin dating. He breaks up with his previous partner, who is heartbroken but reluctantly accepts the conductor's choice. The couple ultimately marries and has three children. Throughout their marriage, they are seen supporting each other in their careers. By the mid-1950s, they live a highly affluent life in the public eye, with the conductor having composed several successful operas and musicals. His wife combats concerns raised about his affairs with men, insistent that she holds rein over him. As the years pass, however, the conductor's dalliances—as well as his alcohol and substance abuse—take a deep toll on their marriage. These issues are compounded when their daughter hears whispers of her father's infidelity. The conductor attempts to deny the rumors as fueled by \"jealousies\". During one holiday, after returning home late from a bender, he and his wife have an explosive argument where she insists that he has hate in his heart, and will \"die a lonely old queen\" if he continues on his current path. Despite the breakdown of their relationship, the couple remains married. In the early 1970s, the conductor performs a legendary concert, and his wife reconciles with him, insistent that \"there's no hate in [his] heart\". She is diagnosed with breast cancer which has metastasized to the lung; despite surgeries and an aggressive chemotherapy regimen, her condition deteriorates, and she dies in her husband's arms. Overcome with grief, he and the children abandon their lavish home shortly afterward. The conductor is shown once again in his later years, teaching and still having affairs with his much younger students. Returning to the interview, he admits that he misses his wife terribly, before his mind flashes back to an image of her, back in their youth, walking into their yard."
