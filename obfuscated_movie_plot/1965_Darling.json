  "obfuscated_plot": "A young model is bored in her marriage to her husband. One day, she meets a literary interviewer/television arts director by chance when his film crew interviews her about young people's views on convention. They begin a relationship, leave their respective spouses, and move in together. They become part of the fashionable media/arts social scene in a major city.\n\nInitially hesitant, the model quickly becomes immersed in the media world, particularly through a powerful advertising executive who helps her career after they have a sexual encounter. The literary interviewer becomes increasingly detached and depressed.\n\nThe model attends a high-class charity event for world hunger, which ironically features wealthy guests amid images of famine victims. She becomes pregnant but chooses to have an abortion to maintain her career. She travels to another country with the advertising executive, experiencing wild parties and gradually adapting to the sophisticated social scene.\n\nHer partner calls her derogatory names upon discovering her affair and leaves her. The advertising executive then casts her in a major advertising campaign. She finds companionship with a gay photographer, and they go shopping, where she impulsively shoplifts.\n\nDuring a photo shoot in a historic location in another country, she meets a wealthy prince who proposes to her. She initially declines but later impulsively marries him. However, the marriage quickly becomes loveless, with her husband frequently absent.\n\nShe returns to her previous city, reconnects briefly with her former partner, and has a sexual encounter that seems to promise reconciliation. However, he reveals he was only seeking revenge and returns her to her life as a princess. The story concludes with her being surrounded by press at an airport, boarding a plane to leave."
