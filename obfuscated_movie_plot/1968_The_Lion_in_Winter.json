  "obfuscated_plot": "An aging monarch seeks to establish a line of succession and summons his family for a winter holiday at his castle. He wants his youngest son to inherit his throne, while his estranged wife, recently released from imprisonment, favors their eldest surviving son, a proven warrior. The monarch invites a neighboring ruler to settle some business, including a marriage arrangement involving the ruler's half-sister, who is currently the monarch's mistress. The monarch agrees to marry his heir-apparent to the half-sister in exchange for his wife surrendering her ancestral lands. \n\nWhen the arrangement is revealed, the eldest son refuses to go through with the marriage â€“ exactly as the monarch anticipated. Perceiving treachery, the youngest son is manipulated by his middle brother to plot against their father with the neighboring ruler. The eldest son then also plots with the neighboring ruler while the younger sons hide and listen. \n\nThe neighboring ruler reveals he has been conspiring separately with each of the sons and suggests a past romantic connection with the eldest. This revelation creates tension and conflict. Recognizing his sons' limitations and plots against him, the monarch imprisons all three sons and plans to travel to seek a marriage annulment, intending to remarry and produce new heirs.\n\nHis wife protests that he will never be able to release their treasonous offspring from prison. Confronting his sons, the monarch ultimately cannot bring himself to harm them, instead letting them escape. Realizing his hopes are lost and recognizing his wife's influence, he becomes resigned and falls into her arms. In the morning, she leaves, and they share a moment of complex affection, understanding their enduring connection despite their conflicts."
