  "obfuscated_plot": "In the 1930s in a large western city, a woman identifying herself as the wife of a municipal water department's chief engineer hires a private investigator to trail her husband. The investigator photographs the husband with a young woman, and the pictures are published in a local newspaper, seemingly exposing their affair. The real wife confronts the investigator and threatens to sue him. When the husband is found dead in a reservoir, the investigator discovers suspicious water management practices during a city-wide drought. \n\nAfter being warned off by a security chief and having his nose slashed by a thug, the investigator begins working for the wife. He learns that the husband was once business partners with the wife's wealthy father. The father offers to double the investigator's fee to find the husband's supposed mistress. \n\nPublic records reveal strange land ownership changes, and the investigator discovers many elderly \"buyers\" who seem unaware of their purchases. He and the wife become romantically involved. He later discovers the missing woman is actually the wife's daughter, who is also her sister - the result of her father sexually abusing her when she was a teenager.\n\nThe wealthy father is revealed to be orchestrating a complex land and water rights scheme, using murder and manipulation to acquire valuable property during the drought. He discredited and killed the husband when he got too close to exposing the plan.\n\nIn a tragic conclusion, when the wife tries to escape with her daughter, she is killed by police. The father takes custody of the daughter, leaving the traumatized investigator powerless to intervene."
