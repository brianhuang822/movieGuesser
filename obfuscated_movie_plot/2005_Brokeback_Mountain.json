After a night of heavy drinking, one cowboy makes a pass at the other. While initially reluctant, the second cowboy becomes receptive, and they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Near the end of their work contract, they have a brawl that leaves both of them bloodied. \n\nThe first cowboy marries his longtime fianc√©e and they have two daughters. The second cowboy moves to another state, where he meets a rodeo rider, the daughter of a wealthy businessman; they marry and have a son. After four years apart, they reunite and rekindle their passionate relationship, which is accidentally witnessed by the first cowboy's wife.\n\nAt a motel, the second cowboy wants them to create a life together, but the first cowboy refuses to abandon his family, haunted by a childhood memory of a man who was tortured and killed for suspected homosexuality. They continue to meet infrequently for private fishing trips while their respective marriages deteriorate.\n\nThe first couple divorces, and the first cowboy refuses to move away from his children. Their relationship continues with occasional meetings and arguments. Eventually, the second cowboy dies in what appears to be an accident. The first cowboy learns of his death and visits the second cowboy's parents, where he discovers a pair of shirts that symbolize their intimate connection.\n\nYears later, the first cowboy lives alone in a trailer. His grown daughter visits to announce her engagement and invite him to her wedding. In his closet, he keeps the two shirts nested together, with a postcard of the mountain where their relationship began, silently mourning his lost love."
