  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 19th century, in a small frontier town, a cowboy slashes a prostitute's face with a knife, permanently disfiguring her. As punishment, the local sheriff orders the cowboy and his associate to compensate her employer for lost revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a bounty for the cowboys' deaths. In a neighboring county, a boastful young man visits a widowed farmer raising two children. The young man claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the criminals. The farmer, formerly a notorious outlaw, is now a repentant widower. Realizing his farm is failing, he recruits a retired outlaw friend, and they join the young hunter, who turns out to be severely near-sighted.\n\nIn the same town, a foreign-born gunfighter arrives with his biographer, seeking the bounty. The sheriff, enforcing the town's antigun law, disarms and beats the gunfighter, banishing him the next morning. The biographer stays, fascinated by the sheriff's insights into frontier justice.\n\nThe farmer, his friend, and the young hunter arrive in town during a rainstorm. The sheriff confronts and beats the farmer, not recognizing his identity. They ambush one of the cowboys, with the farmer ultimately killing him. The friend decides to quit and return home but is later captured and killed by the sheriff.\n\nThe farmer and the young hunter continue their pursuit. After killing one cowboy, the traumatized young hunter confesses he has never killed before. Upon learning of his friend's death, the farmer becomes vengeful. He returns to town alone, killing several men in a brutal gunfight with the sheriff. Before leaving, he shoots the sheriff dead.\n\nA closing note suggests the farmer eventually abandoned his farm, possibly moving to a large coastal city with his children, leaving behind a legacy of violence that his family could never fully understand."
