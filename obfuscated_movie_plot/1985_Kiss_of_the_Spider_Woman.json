The gay prisoner entertains his cellmate by recounting a romantic film narrative, attempting to comfort the activist from the harsh realities of political imprisonment. The activist challenges his cellmate's worldview, encouraging self-respect and political commitment. Despite initial tensions, an unlikely friendship develops between them.\n\nAs their relationship evolves, it becomes clear that the activist is being systematically poisoned, and the gay prisoner is secretly working as an informant for the government, promised early release in exchange for information about the revolutionary group. A romantic connection forms between them, culminating in physical intimacy on the informant's last night in prison.\n\nAfter release, the informant is tasked with contacting the revolutionary group using a provided telephone number. However, the government has been monitoring him. At the arranged meeting, a violent confrontation occurs, and the informant is shot by the revolutionaries. When captured by police, he refuses to divulge information and is killed. His body is discarded, and a false narrative about his death is constructed.\n\nMeanwhile, the imprisoned activist is brutally tortured. After a compassionate doctor helps him, he appears to be dying. In a final sequence, he imagines escaping with his lover, sailing away to a peaceful tropical paradise, symbolizing freedom and hope amidst oppression."
