  "obfuscated_plot": "A historic land rush prompts thousands to travel to a western territory to claim free government land; a pioneering man and his young bride cross a state border to join the throngs. In the ensuing race, the man is outwitted by a young prostitute who takes the prime piece of real estate that he had targeted. His plans for establishing a ranch thwarted, he moves into a boomtown where he confronts and kills an outlaw who had killed the prior publisher of the local newspaper. Having a background in publishing, he establishes a weekly newspaper to help turn the frontier camp into a respectable town. After the birth of their daughter, a gang of outlaws threatens the town, led by an old acquaintance of the man. To save the town, he faces and kills this outlaw. Beset by guilt, he leaves his wife and children to chase another land rush. After his departure, his wife takes over the publication of the newspaper and raises her children until he returns after serving in a military war five years later. He returns just in time to represent the prostitute, who had been charged with being a public nuisance, and wins her acquittal. The town continues to grow, as does the territory, which gains statehood and benefits from an early oil boom. The man supports the local Native American tribes through editorials in his newspaper. He disappears from the town for several years. At the time, his wife is vehemently antiâ€“Native American, despite their son's involvement with a Native woman. Years later, she becomes the first female member of Congress from the state, now lauding the virtues of her Native daughter-in-law. The couple is reunited one final time when she rushes to his side after he has rescued numerous oil drillers from a devastating explosion. He dies in her arms."
