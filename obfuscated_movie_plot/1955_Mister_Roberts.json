  "obfuscated_plot": "During the final stages of a global conflict, a naval cargo ship operates in a remote ocean region far from combat. The young executive officer protects the demoralized crew from their oppressive captain. The captain is prideful about the ship's past achievements, symbolized by a decorative tree on the deck. His junior officer shares quarters with a timid morale and laundry officer who is too intimidated to confront the captain.\n\nThe executive officer desperately wants to join active combat and repeatedly requests a transfer, but the captain consistently blocks his efforts. Eventually, the officer is granted crew shore leave through a superior's intervention. When they reach a beautiful tropical island, the captain cancels the leave. In a private confrontation, the captain demands the officer stop criticizing crew morale and cease transfer requests, threatening his career prospects.\n\nThe officer reluctantly complies, and the crew is granted shore leave. After a wild night, the ship is expelled from port, with the crew confused by the officer's sudden strict behavior. Frustrated by the war's potential end without seeing combat, the officer secretly disposes of the captain's prized decorative tree.\n\nWhen confronted, the officer's heated discussion with the captain is overheard by the crew, revealing the backstory. Weeks later, the officer receives an unexpected transfer. His friend, the ship's doctor, reveals the crew forged the transfer documents. Before leaving, the crew presents him a handmade medal.\n\nWeeks later, the junior officer receives letters. The first is from his transferred colleague, excited about his new combat assignment. The second letter, from a mutual friend, reveals the colleague was killed in a sudden enemy attack. Emboldened, the junior officer finally confronts the captain by throwing away another decorative tree and claiming responsibility for past actions."
