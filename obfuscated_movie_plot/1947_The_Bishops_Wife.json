  "obfuscated_plot": "A religious leader struggling to fund a new church building prays for divine guidance and is seemingly answered by a charismatic angel who reveals himself only to the clergyman. The angel's true mission is to spiritually guide the leader and his family, not to help construct a building. The clergyman has become obsessed with fundraising, straining his relationships with his wife and young daughter. Everyone, except the clergyman, is charmed by the angel, including a skeptical academic. When the angel spends time cheering up the wife, he becomes strongly attracted to her. The clergyman grows jealous and anxious for his guest to leave. The academic urges the clergyman to fight for his wife's affections. The angel persuades a wealthy widow to donate money not for the church, but to help the poor, frustrating the clergyman. Throughout the story, the angel demonstrates supernatural abilities like magically improving ice skating skills, instantly redecorating a Christmas tree, saving an old church by reviving a boys' choir, and secretly writing a sermon. The angel hints to the wife his desire to stay with her, but she senses it is time for him to leave. He acknowledges to the clergyman that it is rare for an angel to envy a mortal. When confronted about derailing the church building plans, the angel reminds the clergyman he prayed for guidance, not a building. With his mission completed and knowing the wife truly loves her husband, the angel departs, erasing all memories of his presence. On Christmas Eve, the clergyman delivers the sermon he believes he wrote."
