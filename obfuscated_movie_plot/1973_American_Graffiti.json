  "obfuscated_plot": "On their last evening of summer vacation in the early 1960s, high school graduates John and Steve meet their friends, a confident drag-racing king and an unpopular but well-meaning friend, at a local drive-in restaurant in a small California town. Set to travel to college in the morning, John has second thoughts about leaving. His sister and Steve's girlfriend is hurt when Steve suggests they see other people while he is away to \"strengthen\" their relationship. En route to the high school dance, John sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white sports car who mouths \"I love you\", leading him to desperately search for her throughout the night. Leaving the dance, he is coerced into joining a group of greasers in stealing coins from arcade machines and hooking a chain to a police car, ripping out its back axle. During a tense ride, the gang leader tells John that the blonde is a prostitute, which he does not believe. Allowed to take care of Steve's car while he is at college, his friend cruises around the strip and picks up a rebellious girl. Telling her he is known by a cool nickname, he spends the night trying to impress her, lying about the car and purchasing alcohol with no ID. The car is stolen while they share a romantic interlude and later, after the alcohol has made him violently sick, he attempts to steal it back. The thieves beat on him until his friend shows up and fends off the attackers. He eventually admits the truth to the girl and reveals he rides a scooter; she suggests it is \"almost a motorcycle\" and says she had fun, agreeing to meet up with him again. Seeking cruising company, the drag racer inadvertently picks up a precocious young girl who manipulates him into driving her around all night. He lies to suspicious friends that she is a cousin he is stuck babysitting, and they have a series of petty arguments until another car's occupants harass her as she attempts to walk home alone, and he decides to protect her. Another racer wants to compete for the drag-racing crown. During his night of challenging anyone he comes across, this rival picks up an emotional girlfriend after a long-brewing argument. Leaving the gang, John drives to the radio station to ask the omnipresent disc jockey to read a message on the air for the blonde. A station employee tells him the DJ does not work there and the shows are taped, claiming the DJ \"is everywhere\". He says the DJ would advise John to \"get your ass in gear\" and see the world but promises to have the DJ air the request. As John leaves, he realizes the employee is the DJ, who reads the message to the blonde asking her to call John at the drive-in payphone. After taking the young girl home, the drag racer is goaded into a race outside the city with a crowd of spectators. His friend starts the race and he takes the lead, but his rival's tire blows out, causing the car to swerve into a ditch and roll over before bursting into flames. Steve rushes to the wreck as the girlfriend and rival crawl out before the car explodes. While the drag racer helps his rival to safety, the girlfriend begs Steve not to leave her and he assures her that he will stay in town. An exhausted John is awakened by the payphone and finally speaks to the mysterious blonde, who hints at the possibility of meeting the following night, but John replies that he is leaving town. In the morning at the airfield, he says goodbye to his parents and friends; after takeoff, he sees the white sports car driving along the road below, and gazes thoughtfully into the sky. An epilogue reveals the friends' fates: a few years later, the drag racer was killed by a drunk driver; another friend was reported missing in action in a war; one became an insurance agent, and John became a writer living in another country."
