  "obfuscated_plot": "A managing editor of a tabloid newspaper is trying to legitimize the paper by improving reporting, but circulation has dropped dramatically. When the owner plans to boost sales with a retrospective series on a 20-year-old murder, the editor reluctantly agrees. He had covered the original story about a stenographer who shot her boss after he reneged on his promise to marry her. Her pregnancy won the jury's sympathy, and she was acquitted. Unaware of impending doom, she is now married to a respected man, and her daughter, who believes her stepfather is her biological father, is about to marry into a prominent family. \n\nThe editor assigns an unscrupulous reporter to dig up dirt, who masquerades as a minister and wins the confidence of the bride's parents on the eve of the wedding. The woman is horrified at the renewed interest in the scandal, and her family members unknowingly share information with the disguised reporter. Her husband realizes the mistake too late.\n\nThe newspaper staff becomes increasingly involved in pursuing the story. When the woman phones the editor begging him to drop the story, he refuses. She subsequently kills herself by taking poison, and her husband discovers her body and then also commits suicide. Reporters document the scene and prepare to publish the sensational story.\n\nThe daughter learns the truth and confronts the newspaper staff. She attempts to shoot the editor but is stopped by her fianc√©, who delivers a scathing condemnation of the newspaper's unethical practices. The editor, consumed by guilt, denounces the owner and resigns. The newspaper's front page about the tragedy is shown being swept away in the rain, symbolizing the disposable nature of such sensationalism."
