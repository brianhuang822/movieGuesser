  "obfuscated_plot": "A dancer from one country travels to a major European city to perform in a show produced by his clumsy associate. While rehearsing a dance routine in his hotel room, he disturbs a woman staying in the room below. She comes upstairs to complain, and he immediately falls in love with her and begins pursuing her throughout the city. The woman mistakes the dancer for his producer, who is married to her friend. After the dancer's successful opening night, he follows the woman to a coastal Italian city, where she is visiting her friend and working as a model for an eccentric Italian fashion designer. The dancer proposes to the woman, who still believes he is her friend's husband and is appalled by his behavior. She agrees instead to marry the fashion designer. However, the producer's interfering valet disguises himself as a clergyman and performs a fake ceremony, having been sent to monitor the situation. During a boat ride, the dancer manages to explain the truth to the woman, and they return to the hotel where all misunderstandings are resolved. The couple celebrates together as evening falls over the Italian city."
