  "obfuscated_plot": "A young woman is sailing from her home country to a colonial territory with an older woman, the mother of her intended bridegroom, who serves as a city magistrate. The ladies are disappointed to find that the colonial community is very much separated from the local population and culture during a period of growing independence movement. They are encouraged when a local school administrator introduces them to an eccentric elderly local scholar. The older woman meets another local professional, a widower who is surprised by her kindness and lack of prejudice. The local professional offers to host an excursion to some nearby caves. The initial exploration of the caves shows that the party size should be limited when the older woman suffers from claustrophobia. She encourages the young woman and the local professional to continue exploring alone with one guide. They reach the caves, and the local professional steps away briefly. The young woman enters a cave alone, becomes distressed, and later runs away disheveled. She is found bleeding and delirious. The local professional is subsequently accused of attempting to assault the young woman and is jailed awaiting trial. The incident becomes a major controversy. The school administrator, who has befriended the local professional, insists on his innocence. The older woman also believes in his innocence and departs for her home country, where she suddenly dies. In court, the young woman unexpectedly declares that no assault occurred, revealing her previous accusation was false. The local professional is freed and celebrated. Abandoned by her community, the young woman is assisted by the school administrator. She plans to return home, while the local professional moves to another region and opens a medical clinic. Eventually, the school administrator marries another woman, and the local professional later writes to the young woman, seeking forgiveness and acknowledging her courage in withdrawing the false accusation."
