  "obfuscated_plot": "A young woman whose father works in law enforcement secretly marries a criminal who claims to have reformed. Her husband attends a theater performance with her and during intermission, slips away to commit a robbery that results in a police officer's murder. Though suspected of the crime, he uses his wife to establish a false alibi. The police insert an undercover agent into the criminal's gang, but the agent is discovered and subsequently murdered by the criminal. Eventually, the criminal is cornered by law enforcement in his own home. Before he can be arrested, he turns off the lights, creating confusion. During the chaos, he escapes to the roof and attempts to jump to a nearby building, but miscalculates the landing and falls to his death."
