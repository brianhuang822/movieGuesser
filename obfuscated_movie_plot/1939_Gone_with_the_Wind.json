  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1861, on the eve of a civil war, a young woman lives at her family's cotton plantation in a southern region, with her parents, two sisters, and their enslaved workers. She is deeply attracted to a local gentleman and learns he is to be married to his cousin. At an engagement party the next day at a nearby plantation, she makes an advance on the gentleman but is rebuffed; however, she catches the attention of another guest, a roguish blockade runner. The party is disrupted by news of a political leader's call for volunteers to fight, and the local men rush to enlist. She marries the cousin's younger brother to arouse jealousy before he leaves to fight. Following her husband's death while serving in the military, her mother sends her to her in-laws' home in a major city. She creates a scene by attending a charity event and dancing with the blockade runner. The tide of war turns against her region's forces. Many local men are killed. As an enemy army besieges the city, she helps her sister-in-law give birth, and the blockade runner helps them flee. She finds her family plantation deserted and her mother recently deceased. With the plantation pillaged and fields untended, she vows to ensure her family's survival. The gentleman returns but can offer little help. Unable to pay imposed taxes, she manipulates a wealthy businessman into marrying her. After her second husband's death, the blockade runner proposes, and she accepts. They have a daughter, but she remains emotionally distant. Rumors of her inappropriate relationship with the gentleman spread. Tragedy strikes when her daughter dies in an accident. As her sister-in-law lies dying, she realizes her true feelings for the blockade runner. He prepares to leave, and despite her pleas, walks away. Heartbroken, she resolves to return home, vowing to one day win him back."
