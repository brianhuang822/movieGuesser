  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1962, during a global political conflict, a mute janitor works in a secret government laboratory in a mid-Atlantic city. Found abandoned as an infant with neck scars, she lives a routine life near a movie theater. Her only friends are her closeted middle-aged neighbor, an advertising illustrator, and her coworker. A military colonel has captured a mysterious creature from a South American river and brought it to the facility for study. The janitor discovers it is a humanoid amphibious being and bonds with the creature after routinely visiting him in secret. Seeking a scientific advantage, the colonel wants to vivisect the creature to examine its biology. A scientist who is secretly a foreign spy pleads to keep the creature alive for further study, while being ordered by his handlers to kill it. When the janitor learns the creature's fate, she convinces her neighbor to help liberate him. The scientist and her coworker eventually join the plan. They successfully smuggle the creature to her apartment, planning to release him into a nearby canal during heavy rain. After some initial challenges, including a confrontation with a cat and a mysterious healing incident, the janitor and creature grow close, eventually becoming intimately connected. Military leadership increases pressure to recover the creature, while the foreign spy is facing extraction. Through a series of dramatic confrontations, the military colonel discovers the creature's location. At the canal, a final confrontation occurs where the colonel shoots both the creature and the janitor. However, the creature heals itself and defeats the colonel. It then takes the janitor into the water, where her neck scars miraculously open into gills, and she is revived. The two embrace, united in their transformation."
