  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-19th century in a European capital, a grieving man murders his wife's doctor after she dies from complications following childbirth. A pioneering chemist has publicized a theory that microscopic organisms cause diseases, arguing that doctors should wash their hands and sterilize instruments in boiling water. The medical establishment dismisses these recommendations as nonsense, with a prominent critic being particularly vocal against the scientist.\n\nThe scientist correctly predicts a high-profile patient will die due to non-sterile medical practices and is considered dangerous because his ideas have seemingly motivated a murder. After facing opposition from governmental leadership, he moves to a small rural town.\n\nIn the following decade, when the national government seeks to rebuild after a war, they discover that many sheep are dying of a deadly disease, except in the scientist's region. They learn he has developed a vaccine through careful research. Despite ongoing opposition from medical experts, he proposes a public experiment demonstrating his vaccine's effectiveness by injecting sheep with a lethal disease. A respected foreign surgeon witnesses the experiment, which proves entirely successful.\n\nThe scientist then turns his attention to another deadly disease spread by a dangerous animal. His initial research methods fail, and his critics mock his efforts. Through his wife's insight, he develops a progressive treatment method. When a desperate mother arrives with her child bitten by a rabid animal, he decides to attempt an untested treatment, risking his professional reputation and potential legal consequences.\n\nSimultaneously, a group of foreign volunteers arrives seeking the same experimental treatment. During this critical period, a personal medical emergency occurs in the scientist's family. He must rely on his former greatest critic to assist with the childbirth, extracting a promise that if the treatment proves successful, the critic will acknowledge his scientific work.\n\nThe scientist suffers a mild health setback but continues his work. Eventually, his treatments are proven successful, and he receives international recognition. His former critics not only acknowledge his groundbreaking work but honor him publicly, transforming him from a dismissed radical to a celebrated medical pioneer."
