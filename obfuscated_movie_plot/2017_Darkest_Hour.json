  "obfuscated_plot": "In a spring month during a major global conflict, the opposition political party in the national legislature demands the resignation of the current prime minister for being too weak against an aggressive foreign power. Conservative Party colleagues want a respected politician as his successor, but he does not feel it is his time. The prime minister chooses the only man whom the opposition will accept as leader of a national government: a veteran politician who had correctly predicted the danger from a rising dictatorial regime but has a poor reputation in the legislature. As an invading army moves into neighboring countries, the new leader is brusque with his new secretary for mishearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife. The monarch, who is skeptical of the leader due to past actions, reluctantly invites him to form a government. The new leader includes his predecessor as a high-ranking council member and another respected politician as Foreign Secretary. The legislature reacts coolly to the leader's first speech promising national determination. His predecessors are appalled by his refusal to negotiate for peace and plan to resign from the government to force a vote of no confidence. The leader visits a foreign prime minister who thinks he is delusional for not admitting that their side is losing a crucial battle, while the leader is furious that the allies do not have a counterattack plan. Although a sympathetic foreign leader is supportive, his actions are limited by domestic political constraints. The leader draws criticism from his cabinet for delivering a radio address implying military progress, earning a rebuke from the monarch. As military forces become trapped in a coastal region, the nation begins preparing for a potential invasion. Against cabinet advice, the leader orders a military unit to distract the enemy and buy time for troop evacuation. The military setback causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with the enemy. Under heavy pressure, the leader considers a negotiated peace but emotionally struggles to draft the request. The monarch unexpectedly visits the leader, offering support to continue fighting. The leader's innovative evacuation plan is initiated. Uncertain, he impulsively rides public transit and asks passengers for their opinions: they all want to continue fighting. He addresses the legislature and finds widespread determination to resist. Delivering a passionate speech, he proclaims national resistance, receiving enthusiastic support. An epilogue reveals that most trapped soldiers were successfully evacuated, the predecessor died months later, a key advisor was reassigned abroad, and the leader was eventually voted out of office after the conflict's conclusion."
