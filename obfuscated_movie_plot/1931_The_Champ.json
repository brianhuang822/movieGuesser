  "obfuscated_plot": "A former world heavyweight boxing champion is down on his luck and living in poverty with his eight-year-old son in a small border town. The father struggles with alcoholism and gambling, repeatedly disappointing his son with broken promises. Despite these challenges, the son remains deeply devoted to his father. After a winning streak, the father buys the son a horse, which they plan to race. At the racetrack, the son encounters a woman who turns out to be his mother, now remarried to a wealthy man. The mother and stepfather observe the son and father, recognizing their relationship. The mother is allowed to see her son, who accepts her but feels no emotional connection. She wants to remove the boy from his difficult living conditions and provide him with a better life. The stepfather confronts the father about the son's future, but the father refuses to give him up. The father loses the horse through gambling, breaking his son's heart. Feeling ashamed, he eventually agrees to let the boy live with his mother and stepfather. On the train, the boy is indifferent but constantly thinks of his father. He runs away back to their original town, finding the father has a crucial boxing match scheduled. Seeing his son, the father becomes motivated, trains seriously, and stays away from his vices. He is determined to win and make his son proud. The mother and stepfather attend the fight, showing support. The match is brutal, and the father is severely injured. Despite urgings to quit, he continues and ultimately wins. After presenting the horse to his son, he collapses. A doctor determines his injuries are fatal. The father encourages his son to be strong before dying. The devastated son cries out for his father, but eventually turns to his mother for comfort, telling her \"The champion is dead\" as she carries him away."
