  "obfuscated_plot": "After a man's suicide, his fellow university alumni and close friends attend his funeral at an old plantation home in a Southern coastal town. During the visit, everyone stays with a married couple. His other friends include a television actor; a former public defender now real-estate attorney; a magazine journalist; a former talk-radio psychologist who is now an impotent war veteran with a drug addiction; and an unfulfilled writer unhappily married to a conservative advertising executive. Also present is the deceased man's young girlfriend who had been living with the hosts. While out jogging early the next morning, the host, violating financial regulations, tells his friend that a large corporation is about to buy his small company, which will make him rich and triple the value of the stock. It is revealed that the host's wife and the deceased had a brief affair years earlier, which all the friends knew about. The host's wife tells another friend that the affair harmed their friendship. The group explores an old house the deceased couple was renovating. Meanwhile, one friend decides she wants to have a child and considers asking her male friends to be the father. The friends drink, reminisce, and confront their aging and unfulfilled lives. Tensions rise during a touch football game, and various interpersonal dramas unfold. Some friends have sexual encounters, others make life-changing decisions. The group reflects on their lost friend and their own disconnected lives. As they prepare to depart, they joke about never leaving, bonded by their shared history and grief."
