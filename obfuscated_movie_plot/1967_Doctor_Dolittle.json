His ability to speak with animals has alienated him from human patients. His housekeeper insists he choose between the animals and her, and he chooses the animals. His talking parrot teaches him hundreds of animal languages, and he prepares for an expedition to find a legendary sea creature.\n\nAfter a confrontation with a local magistrate and his niece, the veterinarian receives a rare creature from a friend and takes it to a circus. He helps a sad seal return to her mate, which leads to his arrest for apparent murder. During his trial, he proves his animal communication skills by revealing private information to the magistrate's dog. Despite this, he is ordered committed to an asylum.\n\nHis parrot helps him escape with the assistance of police horses and dogs. He sets sail with his friend, a young companion, and some animals. They discover the magistrate's niece has stowed away, and she becomes part of the crew. They randomly choose to search for the sea creature on a floating island near the African coast.\n\nAfter a storm destroys their ship, they are captured by the island's sophisticated native inhabitants who blame outsiders for their misfortunes. The veterinarian helps the island's sick animals and convinces a whale to move the island, which ultimately connects back to the African mainland. The natives initially plan to execute them but then revere him as a hero.\n\nHe finds the legendary sea creature, which agrees to transport his companions back home in exchange for medical treatment. The niece wishes to stay and explore, but he declines. After a farewell kiss, he later returns to his hometown riding a magical creature, having been pardoned due to an animal protest and having discovered his feelings for the niece."
