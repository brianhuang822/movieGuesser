  "obfuscated_plot": "In the late 2000s, a disillusioned screenwriter and his fiancée vacation in a famous European city with her wealthy parents. The screenwriter, struggling to finish his debut novel about a man who works in a nostalgia shop, finds himself drawn to the artistic history of the city, especially the artistic movement of the early 20th century, and has ambitions to move there, which his fiancée dismisses. By chance, they meet her old college friend and his wife. The friend speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on local history, annoying the screenwriter but impressing his fiancée. Intoxicated after a night of wine tasting, the screenwriter decides to walk back to their hotel, while his fiancée goes with the other couple by taxi. At midnight, a vintage car pulls up beside him and delivers him to a party attended by notable artists of the early 20th-century art scene. After some encounters and conversations, he discovers he can mysteriously time travel to different historical periods. He becomes particularly drawn to a beautiful costume designer from the past, who shares his fascination with nostalgic eras. As he continues these time-traveling adventures, his relationship with his fiancée deteriorates. Eventually, through his experiences in different time periods, he realizes that constantly longing for the past is futile. He breaks up with his fiancée after discovering her infidelity and decides to stay in the city. While walking alone at night, he meets a kindred spirit who shares his love for the city's romantic atmosphere, suggesting a potential new romantic connection."
