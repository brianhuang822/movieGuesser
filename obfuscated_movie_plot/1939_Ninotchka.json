  "obfuscated_plot": "Three trade agents from a communist government arrive in a European city to sell jewelry confiscated from aristocrats during a historical revolution. A displaced nobleman working as a hotel waiter informs a former royal princess that her family jewels are to be sold by the trio. The princess's charming lover offers to help retrieve the jewelry before its sale.\n\nIn their hotel suite, the agents negotiate with a prominent local jeweler when the lover interrupts, explaining the jewels were seized illegally and a legal petition prevents their sale. The jeweler withdraws his offer. The lover charms the three agents, gets them drunk, and sends a telegram to their capital suggesting a compromise.\n\nDispleased, the government sends a stern female envoy to complete the sale and return the renegade agents. She is methodical and rigid, chastising her colleagues for their failure. She meets the lover on the street, initially uninterested in his flirtations. However, he pursues her, and they eventually fall in love after he persistently tries to make her laugh.\n\nWhile handling legal matters, the envoy becomes seduced by Western culture. During a dinner, she drinks champagne for the first time and becomes intoxicated. The next day, a rival offers her a deal: return the jewels and drop the litigation if she immediately returns to her home country. She reluctantly agrees and flies back with her colleagues.\n\nThe lover follows her but is denied entry to her country. In her home city, she reminisces about her time abroad with her colleagues. Later, she is sent to another city to retrieve the trio, who have now opened a restaurant. She discovers the lover has orchestrated this plan to bring her out of the country. He asks her to stay with him, and she happily agrees.\n\nThe final scene involves one of the agents complaining about unfair treatment regarding the restaurant's signage."
