  "obfuscated_plot": "A young man's father dies before his birth, forcing him to spend his childhood without a father figure. He finds support in his mother and their housekeeper. His mother, feeling the need for a husband, marries a severe and insensitive man who brings his equally harsh sister to live with them. When the boy's mother dies, his stepfather sends him to a large city to work in the family's bottling plant. During this time, he is assisted by a poor but kind family and forms a close friendship with them. The father of this family, despite his courtly manner, cannot manage household expenses and falls into debt. The young man decides to run away from the large city. After many adventures, he reaches a coastal town on foot, where his great-aunt lives. His aunt welcomes him along with her roommate and they send him to boarding school in another town, where he rents a room with a lawyer and forms a sincere friendship with the lawyer's daughter. The young man meets a girl at the ballet and falls in love, eventually marrying her. His wife is young and flighty and inept at running a household, and dies not long after their marriage. The young man and his poor friend then help to unmask the lawyer's corrupt clerk as the forger and cheat that he is and return the lawyer's firm to its rightful owner. The young man and the lawyer's daughter end the story finally expressing their love for each other."
