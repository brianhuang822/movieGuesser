  "obfuscated_plot": "The story takes place in the early 1900s in a small village in a rural region of an eastern European country. The narrative centers on a poor milkman and his family. The milkman occasionally breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience or to the heavens. He and his wife have five daughters and struggle to afford dowries for their marriage. Life in the village is difficult, with constant fear of harassment from neighboring communities. The milkman explains their precarious existence as being like a musician balancing on a rooftop, surviving through obedience to ancient traditions.\n\nA young radical student arrives in the village and is invited to tutor the daughters in exchange for room and board. A local matchmaker has arranged the eldest daughter's marriage to an older, wealthy butcher, but she is in love with a poor tailor. After some negotiation, the milkman allows his daughter to marry her chosen partner.\n\nAt the wedding celebration, tensions arise about marriage choices, and a violent mob attacks the village, destroying property and causing chaos. The radical student is injured while trying to intervene. He later declares his love for another daughter and they plan to marry, despite the father's initial resistance.\n\nWhen the third daughter falls in love with a man from a different religious background, the father cannot accept the relationship and disowns her when she elopes. Eventually, the entire community receives orders to leave their village. The family prepares to relocate to various unknown destinations, with the daughter and her husband planning to move to another region.\n\nThe story concludes with the milkman pulling a wagon of possessions, symbolically accompanied by a metaphorical musician representing their displaced and uncertain future."
