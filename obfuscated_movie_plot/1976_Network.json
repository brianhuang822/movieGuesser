  "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-1970s, an aging news anchor learns from his friend and news division president that he has two weeks left on air due to declining ratings. The following night, the anchor announces he will kill himself on an upcoming broadcast. The network tries to fire him, but his friend intervenes for a dignified farewell. During his broadcast, the anchor launches into an emotional rant about life, which unexpectedly spikes ratings.\n\nThe network executives decide to exploit this situation. The programming chief reaches out to the news division president with a professional offer to develop the anchor's show, and they also begin a personal affair. When the news president wants to end the anchor's \"angry man\" format, the programming chief convinces her boss to move the show to the entertainment division.\n\nThe anchor delivers passionate monologues that galvanize the nation, with viewers shouting a signature angry catchphrase. His new show becomes the most highly rated program on television. Meanwhile, the programming chief makes a controversial deal with a terrorist group for a documentary series.\n\nThe anchor discovers that the network's parent company will be bought by a foreign conglomerate and urges viewers to stop the merger. The company chairman meets with the anchor and convinces him to change his message to serve corporate interests. The programming chief's professional obsession ultimately drives away her lover.\n\nAs the anchor's new, more philosophical messages lose audience interest, the network executives conspire with the terrorist group to assassinate the anchor during a live broadcast. The assassination succeeds, ending his show and launching the terrorist group's documentary series. A final narration suggests this was the first known instance of a television personality being killed due to poor ratings."
