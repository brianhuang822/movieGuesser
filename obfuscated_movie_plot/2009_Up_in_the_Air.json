  "obfuscated_plot": "A traveling consultant works for a human resources firm specializing in employment termination. His job involves traveling across the country to conduct company layoffs on behalf of employers. He also gives motivational speeches about living unencumbered by relationships and possessions, with a goal of achieving ten million frequent flyer miles. During his travels, he meets a professional woman with a similar lifestyle, and they begin a casual relationship.\n\nAt the company headquarters, a young, ambitious new hire suggests implementing video-conferencing for layoffs to cut costs. The protagonist argues that this approach is impersonal and lacks empathy. His boss requires him to mentor the new hire during a series of terminations. They travel together, with the protagonist teaching efficient travel techniques and the new hire challenging his life philosophy.\n\nDuring their trip, the new hire experiences a sudden breakup, and the protagonist and his casual partner comfort her. A test of video terminations reveals the flaws in the impersonal approach, and tensions rise between the two colleagues about commitment and emotional understanding.\n\nThe protagonist then attends his sister's wedding, reluctantly reconnecting with his estranged family. When the groom becomes hesitant, he uses his motivational skills to convince him to proceed with the ceremony. This experience causes him to question his own lifestyle and beliefs.\n\nImpulsively, he travels to see his casual partner, only to discover she is married with children. She explains that their relationship was merely an escape for her. During a flight, he reaches his ten-million-mile milestone, symbolically realizing he has no true home.\n\nBack at the office, a tragic aftermath of a layoff occurs when a terminated employee commits suicide. The video-termination program is shut down, and the new hire leaves the company. She eventually finds a new position with a recommendation from the protagonist.\n\nThe story concludes with the protagonist at an airport, contemplating his next destination, symbolically letting go of his luggage and perhaps his previous way of life."
