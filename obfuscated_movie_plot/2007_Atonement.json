  "obfuscated_plot": "In 1935 in a wealthy family's countryside estate, a 13-year-old girl, the youngest daughter, spies on her older sister and the housekeeper's son from her bedroom window. During an argument by a garden fountain, the housekeeper's son accidentally breaks a vase and yells at the sister to stay where she is. Angered, the sister strips off her outer clothing and climbs into the fountain to retrieve a ceramic piece. The young girl observes from the window and misinterprets their interaction.\n\nThe housekeeper's son drafts a note to the sister, including an explicit version expressing his attraction. By mistake, he asks the young girl to deliver the inappropriate draft. She reads the letter before giving it to her sister. Later, she describes the note to her teenage cousin, who calls the housekeeper's son a \"sex maniac\".\n\nA visiting friend of the family appears attracted to the cousin. Before dinner, the housekeeper's son and the sister are alone in the library, apologize for the letter, and confess their love. They intimately connect as the young girl walks in, mistakenly believing her sister is being assaulted.\n\nDuring dinner, the cousin's twin siblings go missing. While searching, the young girl discovers her cousin being raped by an unidentified man. Despite not clearly seeing the assailant, she convinces herself and her confused cousin that the housekeeper's son is guilty.\n\nThe housekeeper's son is arrested, with the young girl's testimony and the explicit letter convincing everyone of his guilt. Four years later, during World War II, he is released from prison on the condition of joining the military. Separated from his unit, he travels on foot toward an evacuation point, gravely ill from an infected wound.\n\nThe young girl, now a young adult, joins a nursing unit and learns that the real rapist is about to marry her cousin. She attempts to seek forgiveness from her sister but is rejected. Years later, as an elderly and successful novelist, she reveals that her account of reconciliation was fictional. In reality, the housekeeper's son died from his wound, and the sister drowned during a wartime bombing.\n\nShe wrote her novel with a fictional happy ending as a way to provide the lovers the reunion they never experienced, acknowledging her childhood mistake that separated them forever."
