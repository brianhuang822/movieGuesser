  "obfuscated_plot": "An architect returns to a major city for the dedication of a massive skyscraper he designed for a developer. During testing, an electrical short-circuit starts a fire in a storage room, which the architect suspects is due to the electrical subcontractor cutting corners. Despite the architect's concerns, the dedication ceremony continues. A fire breaks out, and the building's chief of fire services forces an evacuation of the top-floor party.\n\nThe fire spreads rapidly through the building, killing several people in various locations. A security chief rescues a mother and her children, but a gas line explosion blocks their escape route. The architect navigates through the building using ventilation shafts and service elevators while attempting to save survivors.\n\nMultiple rescue attempts fail, including a disastrous helicopter rescue that sets the roof on fire. A Navy rescue team sets up a rescue line between the skyscraper and a neighboring building, saving some guests. The architect rigs a scenic elevator for evacuation, but an explosion causes fatal casualties, including a well-intentioned guest.\n\nIn a desperate final strategy, the fire chief and the architect use explosives to burst water tanks, flooding the building and extinguishing the flames. Although several people die, including the city's mayor, most party guests survive. The developer consoles his grieving daughter and vows to prevent such a disaster in the future, while the architect accepts the fire chief's guidance on building safer skyscrapers."
