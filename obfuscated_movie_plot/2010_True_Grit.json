  "obfuscated_plot": "A teenage girl travels to a frontier town after her father is murdered by a hired hand. She learns the killer has fled with an outlaw gang into a lawless territory, where local law enforcement has no jurisdiction. She seeks to hire a deputy marshal known for his ruthlessness, eventually convincing him through her determination and resourcefulness. A state lawman arrives pursuing the same criminal for a different murder, and initially joins forces with the marshal. The girl insists on accompanying them to ensure justice for her father, despite being repeatedly told to stay behind.\n\nThe two lawmen and the girl pursue the criminal gang across rugged wilderness, experiencing tension and conflict among themselves. They encounter other outlaws and gather information about the gang's potential whereabouts. During their journey, they separate and reunite multiple times, driven by conflicting motivations and personal grudges.\n\nEventually, the girl unexpectedly encounters the murderer and shoots him, but is taken hostage. The outlaw gang leader threatens the marshal to abandon the pursuit. When the murderer attempts to kill the girl, another lawman arrives and helps neutralize the threat. In a dramatic confrontation, the marshal and the outlaws engage in a violent shootout, with the other lawman providing critical support.\n\nThe girl is bitten by a snake during the chaos and is rescued by the marshal, who carries her to safety despite significant personal risk. She receives medical treatment, losing a limb in the process, and never fully reunites with the marshal until years later.\n\nDecades afterward, she learns of the marshal's death and has his body transported to her family's cemetery, reflecting on their complex relationship and the journey that bonded them. She considers seeking out the other lawman but remains uncertain."
