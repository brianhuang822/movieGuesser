    "plot": "In 1964, three civil rights workers – two Jewish and one black – went missing while they were in fictional Jessup County, Mississippi (the actual events took place in Neshoba County ), organizing a voter registry for African Americans . The FBI sends Alan Ward and Rupert Anderson to investigate. Ward is a Northerner, senior in rank but much younger than Anderson, and approaches the investigation by the book. In contrast, Anderson, a former sheriff in Mississippi, is more nuanced in his approach. The pair find it difficult to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies influence the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan . With the help of the son of a local pastor, the FBI is finally able to bring forward a witness who saw Klansmen firebomb a house, and three white men are arrested and tried for felony arson. A local judge, however, gives the men a token suspended sentence while deriding the FBI as \"outside agitators\" who provoked the men to violence. He then releases the men, who promptly hang the witness's father and attempt to kill the witness. The FBI evacuates the family to the north and realizes they will receive no help at all from local authorities. Meanwhile, Anderson has developed a close relationship with the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell, who, in a tearful confession, reveals to Anderson that the three missing men have been murdered by her husband and his Klansmen accomplices, who then buried the bodies in an earthen dam . After the bodies are discovered, revealing to the nation that the disappearance of the civil rights workers was murder, Pell brutally beats his wife for her betrayal. Ward and Anderson's different approaches spill over into a physical fight, which ends with Ward pulling a gun and admitting that his methods have been ineffective, and he gives Anderson carte blanche to deal with the problem in his way. Anderson devises a plan to indict members of the Klan for civil rights violations instead of murder , because civil rights violations are federal crimes for which conviction is more certain than state-level charges of murder. The FBI arranges the kidnapping of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack, where he is left with a black man who threatens to castrate him unless he speaks out. Tilman gives him a complete description of the killings, including the names of those involved. The abductor is revealed to be an FBI operative who has been assigned to intimidate Tilman. Although the obtained information is inadmissible in court because it was obtained through coercion, it still proves valuable to the investigators. Anderson and Ward concoct a plan, luring identified Klan collaborators to a bogus meeting. Still, the men soon realize that they have been set up, and they leave the fake meeting without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrates on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest who exhibits a nervous demeanor, which the agents believe might yield a confession. The Feds pick him up and interrogate him. Anderson stages a tussle with Pell at the local barbershop in retaliation for the attack on his wife and takes off. Later, Cowens is at home when a shotgun blast shatters his windows. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, he attempts to flee in his truck but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The team arrives to rescue him, having staged the entire scene where the hooded men are revealed to be other FBI agents. Cowens, believing that his redneck brothers have threatened his life because of his admissions to the FBI, finally incriminates his accomplices. The Klansmen are charged with civil rights violations. Most of the perpetrators are convicted and sentenced to 3–10 years in prison, while Sheriff Stuckey is acquitted. The FBI later finds Tilman has hanged himself, and Bird wonders why. Ward tells him Tilman was guilty, for being a witness. Mrs. Pell returns to her home, which vandals have completely ransacked. She resolves to stay and rebuild her life, free of her husband. Before they leave town, Anderson and Ward visit an integrated congregation, gathered at an African American cemetery, where the black civil rights activist's desecrated gravestone reads, \"Not Forgotten.\"",

    "plot": "Jerry Warriner tells his wife he is going on vacation to Florida but instead disappears for two weeks without telling anyone where he is really going. He returns home, with a sunlamp tan, to find that his wife, Lucy, spent the night in the company of her handsome voice teacher, Armand Duvalle. Lucy claims his car broke down unexpectedly, but Jerry refuses to believe Lucy’s assurances that nothing untrustworthy happened. Upon seeing the oranges in the basket Jerry brought home from Florida stamped “California”, however, Lucy discovers that Jerry did not actually go to Florida. Their mutual suspicion results in divorce proceedings, with custody of their dog, “Mr. Smith,” in dispute. When the judge pronounces that he will grant custody to whomever Mr. Smith responds to when called, Lucy wins custody with concealed dog toy in her hand. The judge grants Jerry visiting rights to the dog and orders the divorce finalized in 90 days. Lucy moves into an apartment with her Aunt Patsy. Her neighbor is amiable but rustic Oklahoma oilman Dan Leeson, whose mother does not approve of Lucy. On a visitation to Mr. Smith, Jerry subtly ridicules Dan in front of Lucy, which causes Lucy defiantly to cling closely to Dan. Jerry begins dating sweet-natured but simple singer Dixie Belle Lee, unaware that she performs a vulgar act at a local nightclub where a wind machine blows her skirt up. When Lucy and Dan turn up at the nightclub and see the act, Jerry is embarrassed, and Lucy makes witticisms as payback for Jerry’s ridicule of Dan. Convinced that Lucy is still having an affair with Duvalle, Jerry bursts into Duvalle's apartment only to discover that Lucy is a legitimate vocal student of Duvalle and is giving her first recital in front of an audience. When Lucy announces her engagement to Dan, realizing he may still love Lucy, Jerry undermines Lucy's character with Mrs. Leeson, implying Lucy’s infidelity as the cause of their divorce. On a subsequent visit to Mr. Smith, Jerry arrives as Duvalle is paying an unexpected visit to Lucy. Alarmed that Jerry will think Duvalle is there at her request, Lucy asks Duvalle to hide in her bedroom while Jerry plays with the dog. During a game of hide-and-seek, Mr. Smith reveals Duvalle’s forgotten hat where Lucy hid it just before Jerry entered the salon. Meanwhile, Dan and his mother arrive; Jerry sarcastically states that he never had any doubt about Lucy’s fidelity, while Dan and his mother apologize for assuming the worst about her. Jerry discovers Duvalle hiding in Lucy's bedroom and they end up in a fistfight.  When Jerry chases Duvalle out the door, Mrs. Leeson assumes the worst is true, and Dan breaks off his engagement to Lucy; he and his mother return to Oklahoma. A few weeks later, Jerry begins dating high-profile heiress Barbara Vance, whose romance is covered in the society column. Realizing she still loves Jerry, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion the night the divorce decree is to become final. Pretending to be Jerry's sister, she undermines Jerry's character, implying that \"their\" father was working class rather than wealthy. Acting like a showgirl, she recreates Dixie's risqué musical number. The snobbish Vances are appalled. Jerry attempts to explain away Lucy's behavior as drunkenness , and says he will drive Lucy home. Lucy repeatedly sabotages the car on the ride to delay their parting. Pulled over by motorcycle police officers, who believe Jerry is drunk, Lucy manages to wreck the car. The police give the couple a lift to Aunt Patsy's nearby cabin. Although sleeping in different (but adjoining) bedrooms, Jerry and Lucy slowly overcome their pride and a series of comic mishaps in order to admit \"the awful truth\" that they still love one another. They reconcile at midnight, just before their divorce is to be finalized.",

Cecil appoints Francis Walsingham , a Protestant exile returned from France, to act as Elizabeth's bodyguard and adviser. Mary of Guise , acting as regent for her young daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots , brings an additional 4,000 French troops to neighbouring Scotland . Unfamiliar with military strategy and browbeaten by Norfolk at the war council, Elizabeth orders a military response, which proves disastrous when the professional French soldiers defeat the inexperienced, ill-trained English forces. Walsingham tells Elizabeth that Catholic lords and priests intentionally deprived Elizabeth's army of proper soldiers and used their defeat to argue for Elizabeth's removal. Realising the depth of the conspiracy against her and her dwindling options, Elizabeth accepts Mary of Guise's conditions to consider marrying her nephew Henry, Duke of Anjou .

    "plot": "In an isolated mountain chalet near Grenoble , novelist Sandra Voyter decides to reschedule her interview with a female student because her husband, university lecturer Samuel Maleski, plays music loudly in their attic, disrupting the interview. After the student drives away from the chalet, Sandra's eleven-year-old son Daniel, who is visually impaired, takes a walk outside with his guide dog Snoop. When they return home, Daniel finds Samuel dead from an apparent fall. Sandra insists that the fall must have been accidental. Her old friend and lawyer, Vincent, suggests the possibility of suicide , while Sandra recalls her husband's attempt to overdose on aspirin six months earlier, after going off antidepressants . After an investigation, Daniel's conflicting accounts of what happened shortly before his father's death, combined with the revelation that Samuel sustained a head wound before his body hit the ground and an audio recording of a fight between Samuel and Sandra the previous day, Sandra is indicted on charges of homicide. She is released on bail soon after. One year later, Sandra's trial begins. Her defense team claims Samuel fell from the attic window and hit his head on a shed below, while the prosecution posits that Sandra hit him with a blunt object and pushed him from the second-floor balcony. During a courtroom argument with Samuel's psychiatrist, Sandra admits her resentment toward her husband due to his partial responsibility for the accident that led to Daniel's impaired vision. In the recorded fight, Samuel accuses Sandra of plagiarism , infidelity, and exerting control over his life, before their protracted argument turns physically violent. The prosecution claims that all the violence came from Sandra. She counters that while she had slapped Samuel, the rest of the violence heard was her husband self-harming. After Sandra admits to an affair with a woman the year before Samuel's death, the prosecution argues that Samuel's loud music indicated jealousy over Sandra's flirting with the interviewer, leading to the physical confrontation later. The prosecutor also notes Sandra's pattern of writing personal conflicts into her stories, and how murdering her husband mirrors a minor character's thoughts from her most recent novel. In turn, Sandra protests that one recording does not represent the nature of their relationship, nor do the words of a character in a novel reflect her own inclinations. A distraught Daniel insists on testifying before closing arguments the following Monday. The judge lays strict ground rules to prevent anyone from influencing his testimony and brings in a court monitor, Marge. Daniel then asks that Sandra leave their house for the weekend so he can be alone with Marge and Snoop. He recalls that when Samuel overdosed, Snoop also fell sick, possibly due to having eaten Samuel's vomit. He then deliberately feeds Snoop aspirin and finds it has the same effect, which aligns with Sandra's testimony. Daniel confides to Marge his anguish, and she advises him that if he doesn't know what is really true, he can instead decide what's true for him. On the witness stand, Daniel says he can comprehend his father taking his own life but not the murder scenario. He says that when he and Samuel were driving Snoop to the veterinarian, Samuel spoke about the need to be prepared that those he loves will die and to know that his life will go on, which Daniel now interprets as his father's own suicidal thoughts. Sandra is acquitted following Daniel's testimony. When she returns home, Daniel tells her he was afraid of her homecoming and she says that she was too; the two embrace. As Sandra heads to bed, she lingers at a photo of her and Samuel before falling asleep with Snoop.",

When they return home, the boy finds his father dead from an apparent fall. The novelist insists that the fall must have been accidental. Her old friend and lawyer suggests the possibility of suicide, while the novelist recalls her husband's attempt to overdose on medication six months earlier, after going off antidepressants. After an investigation, the boy's conflicting accounts of what happened shortly before his father's death, combined with the revelation that the husband sustained a head wound before his body hit the ground and an audio recording of a fight between the spouses the previous day, the novelist is indicted on charges of homicide. She is released on bail soon after. One year later, her trial begins. Her defense team claims the husband fell from the attic window and hit his head on a shed below, while the prosecution posits that she hit him with a blunt object and pushed him from the second-floor balcony. During a courtroom argument with the husband's psychiatrist, the novelist admits her resentment toward her husband due to his partial responsibility for the accident that led to their son's impaired vision. In the recorded fight, the husband accuses the novelist of plagiarism, infidelity, and exerting control over his life, before their protracted argument turns physically violent. The prosecution claims that all the violence came from the novelist. She counters that while she had slapped her husband, the rest of the violence heard was her husband self-harming. After the novelist admits to an affair with a woman the year before her husband's death, the prosecution argues that the husband's loud music indicated jealousy over the novelist's flirting with the interviewer, leading to the physical confrontation later. The prosecutor also notes the novelist's pattern of writing personal conflicts into her stories, and how murdering her husband mirrors a minor character's thoughts from her most recent novel. In turn, the novelist protests that one recording does not represent the nature of their relationship, nor do the words of a character in a novel reflect her own inclinations. A distraught son insists on testifying before closing arguments the following Monday. The judge lays strict ground rules to prevent anyone from influencing his testimony and brings in a court monitor. The boy then asks that his mother leave their house for the weekend so he can be alone with the monitor and the dog. He recalls that when his father overdosed, the dog also fell sick, possibly due to having eaten his father's vomit. He then deliberately feeds the dog medication and finds it has the same effect, which aligns with his mother's testimony. The boy confides to the monitor his anguish, and she advises him that if he doesn't know what is really true, he can instead decide what's true for him. On the witness stand, the boy says he can comprehend his father taking his own life but not the murder scenario. He says that when he and his father were driving the dog to the veterinarian, his father spoke about the need to be prepared that those he loves will die and to know that his life will go on, which the boy now interprets as his father's own suicidal thoughts. The novelist is acquitted following her son's testimony. When she returns home, the boy tells her he was afraid of her homecoming and she says that she was too; the two embrace. As the novelist heads to bed, she lingers at a photo of her and her husband before falling asleep with the dog."

    "name": "Pulp Fiction",
    "plot": "Pulp Fiction ' s narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime. [ 9 ] The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles: If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is \"an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative\". [ 10 ] Other analysts describe the structure as a \"circular narrative\". [ 11 ] [ 12 ] A pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees, and they begin the robbery. Two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. On the way, Vincent mentions that he had been tasked by Marsellus to take his wife, Mia Wallace , to dinner and asks Jules questions about Mia. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites what is portrayed as a passage from the Book of Ezekiel , before he and Vincent kill Brett. Jules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge to intentionally lose in his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in a twist contest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in an overdose . Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where Lance helps revive her by getting adrenaline for Vincent to inject into her heart . Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident. Butch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom to find Butch pointing the gun at him. Butch shoots Vincent dead and departs. While Butch is stopped at a traffic light, he sees Marsellus crossing the road. Butch rams his car into him and knocks him over, but is himself injured when his vehicle collides with another. Marsellus recovers, shoots at Butch and chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, task their gimp sex slave with watching Butch while they take Marsellus into another room and begin to rape him. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with a katana from the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that he will call his crew to help him torture Zed to death. He further tells Butch that they are \"cool\" (even) and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper and they ride away. In the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was a miracle , which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett's friends, Marvin (who was actually a plant from Marsellus's organization), Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head when Jules drives over a bump in the road, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules's old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends a cleaner , Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard. At the diner from the film's prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment was divine intervention . While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.",

    "plot": "An aged Henry Van Cleve enters the opulent reception area of \" where innumerable people had told him so often to go \", to be personally greeted by \" His Excellency \". Henry petitions to be admitted (fully aware of the kind of life he has led), but  some doubt exists as to his qualifications. To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life. Born in Manhattan on October 25, 1872, Henry is the spoiled only child of stuffy, naive, wealthy parents Randolph and Bertha. His paternal grandmother is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve, a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up to be an idle young man with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone. Intrigued, he follows her into a Brentano's bookstore and pretends to be an employee to get to know her better. Despite learning that she is engaged to marry, he begins making advances, finally confessing he does not work there, whereupon she hastily departs. Later, his obnoxious cousin Albert introduces the family to his fiancée, Martha, and her feuding parents, the Strables. Henry is shocked to find that his mystery woman and Martha are one and the same. It turns out that Albert was the first suitor of whom both her parents approved. Fearful of spending the rest of her life as a spinster in Kansas City, Martha agreed to marry him. Henry convinces her to elope with him instead. Though everyone except Grandpa Van Cleve is scandalized, eventually they are received back into the family. Henry and Martha enjoy a happy marriage and become the proud parents of a boy. On the eve of their tenth anniversary, however, Martha finds out about what appears to be Henry's continuing dalliances with other women and goes back to her parents. Henry and Grandpa follow her there. Sneaking into the Strable house, Henry corrects the misunderstanding, begs her forgiveness, and talks her into \"eloping\" a second time, much to Grandpa's delight. Fifteen years later, Henry meets chorus girl Peggy Nash in her dressing room shortly before her performance. What seems to be an attempt at courtship is soon revealed as an attempt by Henry to turn her away from his son, Jack, who has been dating her. When Peggy reveals her knowledge of his true identity, Henry buys her off, instead, for $25,000 (equivalent to about $390,000 in 2024). Jack later reveals he was glad to have got rid of her so easily. Martha passes away shortly after their 25th anniversary. Henry resumes an active social life much to the amusement of his son.

    "plot": "One September morning, the Soviet Navy submarine Sprut (Octopus) draws too close to the New England coast when its captain wants to see North America. and runs aground on a sandbar near Gloucester Island (a fictional island apparently loosely based on Martha's Vineyard) off the New England coast, with a population of about 200 people. Rather than radio for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain sends a nine-man landing party, headed by his zampolit (Political Officer) Lieutenant Yuri Rozanov, to find a motor launch to help free the submarine. The men arrive at the house of Walt Whittaker, a vacationing playwright from New York City. Whittaker is eager to get his wife Elspeth and children, Pete and Annie, off the island now that summer is over. Pete tells his disbelieving dad that armed Russians are near the house, but Walt is soon met by Rozanov and one of his men, Alexei Kolchin, who identify themselves as strangers on the island and ask if there are any boats available. Walt is skeptical and asks if they are armed Russians. Startled, Rozanov admits that they are and pulls a gun on Walt. Rozanov promises no harm to the Whittakers if they surrender their station wagon. Elspeth provides the car keys, but before the Russians depart, Rozanov orders Alexei to prevent the Whittakers from fleeing. The station wagon quickly runs out of gasoline, forcing the Russians to walk. They steal an old sedan from Muriel Everett, the postmistress; she calls Alice Foss, the gossipy telephone switchboard operator, and soon, rumors about Russian parachutists and an air assault on the airport throw the island into confusion. Police Chief Link Mattocks and his deputy Norman Jonas try to squelch a \"citizens' militia\" led by Fendall Hawkins, head of the local VFW . Meanwhile, Walt, Elspeth and Pete overpower Alexei when Alison Palmer, an 18-year-old neighbor and Annie's babysitter, arrives for work, giving them an opening. Alexei flees, but when Walt, Elspeth, and Pete leave to find help, he returns to retrieve his weapon from the house, where only Alison and Annie remain. Despite wanting no fighting, Alexei must obey his superiors in guarding the residence. He promises not to harm anyone and offers to surrender his gun as proof. Alison trusts him and does not want his firearm. Walt is recaptured by the Russians in the telephone central office. After subduing Mrs. Foss, tying her and Walt together and disabling the island's telephone switchboard, seven Russians appropriate civilian clothes from a dry cleaner's, steal a cabin cruiser, and head back to the submarine. Back at the Whittaker house, Alexei and Alison talk, kiss, and fall in love. At the phone exchange, Walt and Mrs. Foss hop outside the office. They are eventually discovered by Elspeth and Pete, who untie them. They return to their house; and Walt shoots at and almost kills Rozanov, who reached there ahead of them. With the misunderstandings cleared up, the Whittakers, Rozanov, and Alexei decide to head into town together to explain to everyone what is happening. As the tide rises, the sub floats off the sandbar. The Sprut proceeds on the surface to the island's main harbor to recover the landing party. Chief Mattocks, having investigated and debunked the rumor of an airborne assault, returns to town with the unorganized militia. With Rozanov acting as translator, the Russian captain threatens to open fire on the town unless the seven missing sailors are returned to him; his crew faces upwards of a hundred townspeople armed with everything from .22 caliber rifles and 12 gauge shotguns to military surplus battle rifles . Two small boys climb up to the church steeple to see better. One slips and falls but his belt catches on a gutter, leaving him hanging 40 feet in the air.

    "plot": "Lou Gehrig is a young Columbia University student whose old-fashioned mother wants him to study hard and become an engineer, but the young man has a gift for baseball. A sportswriter befriends Gehrig and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother gets sick, Gehrig signs with the team he has always revered, the New York Yankees , to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he endeavors to keep his career change a secret from his mother. Gehrig works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the Yankees. His hero, Babe Ruth , is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over Ruth and the rest of the team. Gehrig is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on Ruth on the team train. During a game at Comiskey Park , Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor (the daughter of the ballpark hot dog magnate), who laughingly calls him \"tanglefoot\". Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. Gehrig's mother, who still has not accepted the fact that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; Gehrig finally stands up to her, and marries Eleanor. The Yankees become the dominant team in baseball, and Gehrig becomes a fan favorite. His father and fully converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a re-creation of a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story, Gehrig visits a crippled boy named Billy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single World Series game in the boy's honor—then fulfills his promise. Gehrig is now the \"Iron Horse\", a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife. Then he begins to notice, with growing alarm, that his strength is slowly ebbing away. Though he continues to play, and extends his consecutive-game streak to a seemingly insurmountable record, his physical condition continues its inexorable decline. One day, in Detroit , he tells Yankees manager Joe McCarthy that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself. After an examination, a doctor gives him the awful news: Gehrig has a rare, incurable disease , and only a short time to live. A short time later, on Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium , an older Billy finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero's example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: \"People all say that I've had a bad break. But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\"",

    "obfuscated_plot": "A young university student from a working-class family is pressured by his old-fashioned mother to study hard and become an engineer, but he has a natural gift for baseball. A sportswriter befriends the student and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother falls ill, the young man signs with a professional baseball team in a large northeastern city to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he tries to keep his career change a secret from his mother. He works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the major league team. His hero, a legendary slugger on the team, is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over the veteran and the rest of the team. The young player is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on the veteran during team travels. During a game at a ballpark in a midwestern city, the player trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, a woman who is the daughter of a concessions businessman, who laughingly calls him clumsy. Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. The player's mother, who still has not accepted that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; he finally stands up to her and marries his fiancée. The team becomes dominant in the sport, and the player becomes a fan favorite. His father and now-converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a recreation of a famous story, the player visits a disabled boy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single championship game in the boy's honor—then fulfills his promise. The player is now a celebrated athlete, a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife.

    "plot": "In 1949, former United States Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall spots a familiar Toby Jug in an English antique shop and learns it came from Archbury, where Stovall served during World War II. Convinced it's the same jug from the airfield's officers' club, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield, where he reflects on his wartime experiences. In a flashback , the setting shifts to 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury has gained a reputation as a \"hard luck group\". After a  disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads through the group's senior leadership, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command . Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. When Davenport refuses to discipline failed navigator Lieutenant Zimmerman, Pritchard realizes Savage is right, relieves Davenport of command, and places Savage in command. Savage takes a harsh approach to restoring the group's discipline and morale. He reprimands Gately, demotes him to aircraft commander, and insists he fly every mission. Savage assigns Gately the least competent crewmen and orders him to paint the name \"Leper Colony\" on his airplane. Rough-and-ready Major Cobb impresses Savage with his independent spirit and replaces Gately as Air Exec. Savage conducts a series of training missions and waits for an opportunity to restore the group's pride in its abilities. Upset by the contrast of Savage's stern leadership with Davenport's easygoing ways, all of the group's pilots apply for transfer. Savage asks the Group Adjutant , Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time. When several groups are ordered to abort a combat mission due to heavy weather, Savage ignores the recall order and the 918th is the only group to successfully bomb the target. Savage claims he didn't hear the recall due to a radio malfunction and persuades a furious Pritchard to recommend the group for a Distinguished Unit Citation . Savage also convinces Lieutenant Jesse Bishop, a Medal of Honor recipient, to be Savage's eyes and ears among the combat aircrews.\nWhen the Inspector General arrives to investigate the transfer requests, Savage packs his belongings, expecting to be relieved or court-martialed. But, led by Bishop, the pilots withdraw their requests. Savage softens his attitude towards the men as he becomes more closely involved with them. Gately goes on to win Savage's respect by demonstrating extraordinary leadership and courage in combat. With enemy resistance intensifying as the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier and many of Savage's best men are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command, but Savage feels that the 918th is not yet ready to do without him. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. Ordered to return to the same target after a particularly brutal raid on a ball bearing factory, Savage finds himself physically unable to haul himself up into his B-17 . Gately takes his place as lead pilot and strike commander for the mission. While waiting for the group's return, Savage becomes catatonic . Only as they return to Archbury does he regain his composure and fall asleep. The story then returns to 1949, as Stovall pedals away from Archbury.",

    "plot": "Guy Holden, a famous American dancer, is at a Paris nightclub with his friend, scatterbrained English lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, when they both realize that they have forgotten their wallets. After Guy dances for the audience to avoid washing dishes to work off the bill, Egbert discovers his wallet in a different pocket. Traveling to England by ship, Guy encounters Mimi Glossop, whose dress has been caught when closing a trunk, asking Guy to call a porter to open the trunk to free her. Taking advantage of the situation, Guy teases her and attempts to free her dress, but ends up tearing the skirt at thigh level, angering Mimi. Chastised, Guy apologizes and gives Mimi his coat to cover up, and asks for her address to retrieve his coat, but Mimi insists that she will mail it back at the address he provides. Mimi returns the coat, paying the courier not to disclose her contact information. After searching for Mimi in London for two weeks, Guy ends up serendipitously rear-ending her car in traffic. As Mimi drives away and races to evade him, he chases her into the country. Taking a shortcut, Guy sets up a fake roadblock, trapping her, offering her an impromptu picnic and casually proposing marriage. Convinced that he is insane, she rebuffs his attempts to charm her and attempts to tear up notes with his phone number (but keeps one), but he learns that her name is Mimi. Coincidentally, Mimi seeks a divorce from her geologist husband, Cyril Glossop, who she has not seen for some time. Under the guidance of her domineering and much-married Aunt Hortense, she consults bumbling lawyer Egbert Fitzgerald, once a fiancé of her aunt. He arranges for Mimi to spend a night at a seaside hotel in Brightbourne and to be caught flagrante delicto in a staged \"adulterous relationship\", a purpose for which he hires a professional co-respondent , Rodolfo Tonetti. In an unrelated previous conversation with Guy, Egbert had been impressed when Guy philosophically used the phrase, \"Chance is the fool's name for fate\". Without Guy's knowledge and without intending any connection, Egbert gives Mimi the expression as a code phrase to identify her co-respondent. Accompanying his friend Egbert to the hotel, the besotted and unaware Guy encounters Mimi, who has warmed up to him, and admits that she attempted to contact the phone number that he gave her. He sings Cole Porter 's \" Night and Day \" to her, and they fall under a spell while dancing together. Wanting to impress Mimi, Guy waxes philosophical, inadvertently using the code phrase that Egbert has given Mimi to identify the co-respondent. Appalled, Mimi mistakes him for the co-respondent who she has been expecting, considering him not much more than a gigolo . When Mimi gives Guy her room number and makes it clear that she expects him \"at midnight\", Guy is astonished by her seemingly brazen attitude. Guy keeps the \"appointment\" in Mimi's bedroom, and Tonetti arrives, revealing the truth and clearing up the misunderstandings. Not trusting Tonetti alone with Mimi, Guy insists on staying, potentially thwarting the point of a co-respondent for Mimi's divorce case. Tonetti insists that Mimi and Guy not foil the plan by being seen together outside of the bedroom. While Tonetti is busy playing solitaire in another room, Guy and Mimi contrive to escape and dance the night away. An elaborate 16-minute dance sequence, \" The Continental \", follows, with Mimi singing the introduction, another singer and ensembles of dancers doing routines, and Guy and Mimi joining in. In the morning, after several mistakes with the waiter, Guy hides in the next room when Cyril arrives at the door, while Mimi and Tonetti pretend that they are lovers. When Cyril does not believe that Mimi would fall for Tonetti, Guy comes out and embraces Mimi in an attempt to convince Cyril that he is her lover, but to no avail. Cyril does not want a divorce from a wealthy wife. The unwitting waiter ultimately reveals that Cyril is an adulterer, having come to another hotel on previous occasions with another woman, thus clearing the way for Mimi to obtain a divorce and marry Guy.",

Dith Pran , a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for The New York Times , awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city's airport, but leaves suddenly. Schanberg takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with photographer Al Rockoff . Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an American B-52 has allegedly bombed Neak Leung . After Schanberg and Pran go to the town and confirm the allegation, they are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army. Two years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh embassies are evacuated in anticipation of the Khmer Rouge's arrival. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran's family, but Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital , ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg and Rockoff are met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare his friends' lives, and the group retreats to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over, to which the fearful ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when Pran's image on the passport photo disappears, as they lack adequate photographic fixer . Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and forced to live under their totalitarian regime. Several months after returning to New York City , Schanberg launches a personal campaign to locate Pran; he writes letters to several charities and maintains close contact with Pran's family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge's \" Year Zero \" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education . As intellectuals are made to disappear , Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he escapes and stumbles upon one of the Pol Pot regime's Killing Fields before he is found unconscious on the riverside and taken in by a different cadre of Khmer Rouge. In 1976, Schanberg is awarded the fictional AIFPC journalism award (a stand-in for the real Schanberg’s Pulitzer Prize ) for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict, and he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. Rockoff confronts Schanberg and harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Although Schanberg initially defends his efforts, he ultimately admits that Pran stayed because of what Schanberg wanted. Pran is shown living in a Khmer Rouge-held village led by a man named Phat, where he does household chores and tends to Phat's young son. Phat makes several attempts to test Pran’s understanding of French and English, but Pran continues to hide his education, claiming to have been a taxi driver before the revolution. This ruse continues until Phat catches him at night listening to an English language radio broadcast. However, rather than punishing him, Phat confides in Pran about his distrust of the Khmer Rouge leadership, and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. During the Khmer Rouge's border war with Vietnam , Pran discovers that Phat's son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four of Phat’s comrades and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat's son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with the fourth man. However, Pran's companion activates a hidden land mine while holding the boy. As Pran pleads with the man to give him the boy, the mine goes off, killing the pair. Pran continues through the jungle alone until he eventually finds a Red Cross refugee camp near the border of Thailand . In the United States, Schanberg learns that Pran is alive and safe, and reunites with Pran at the Red Cross camp. Pran assures Schanberg of his forgiveness as the two embrace.",

A drifter, he is hired as a farmhand by hardscrabble rancher Joe Starrett, who is homesteading with his wife, Marian, and their young son, Joey. Starrett tells Shane that a war of intimidation is being waged on the valley's settlers.

    "plot": "Father Charles \"Chuck\" O'Malley, an incoming priest from East St. Louis , is transferred to St. Dominic's Catholic Church in New York City . On his first day, his unconventional style gets him into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and casual attitude initially make a poor impression with the elder priest, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O'Malley's recreational habits – particularly his golf-playing – and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O'Dowd. O'Dowd tricks O'Malley into revealing that he was actually sent by the bishop to replace Fitzgibbon and take charge of the parish's affairs, with Fitzgibbon remaining on as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon's feelings, O'Malley pretends that he was sent to serve as the elderly priest's assistant. The difference between O'Malley and Fitzgibbon's styles is openly apparent as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference arises in their handling of the church youth, many of whom consistently get into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O'Malley wants to help  the boys' to improve their lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to form a church choir. The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who goes to the bishop and asks for O'Malley to be transferred to another parish. In the course of their conversation, Fitzgibbon realizes the bishop sent O'Malley to take charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O'Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate, he informs O'Malley of his new role. Distressed, Fitzgibbon goes walking in a rainstorm for several hours and returns late that night. O'Malley puts the older priest to bed, and the two finally begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon's long unfulfilled desire to go to Ireland to visit his mother, now over 90 years old. O'Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, \" Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral \". O'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career singing with the Metropolitan Opera , under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage in a performance of Carmen , the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss O'Malley's letter explaining he had entered the priesthood. O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage holder. O'Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life, to follow the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same, sung as his composition \"Going My Way\". When the junior Haines is later confronted by his father, the father discovers that he and Carol have married, and he has joined the Army Air Corps. Jenny visits O'Malley at the church, sees the boys' choir, and reads the sheet music of \"Going My Way\". She, O'Malley, and O'Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan Opera House, have the choir perform the song with a full orchestra, then sell the publishing rights, saving the church from its financial woes. When Max Dolan, the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell, the choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings \" Swinging on a Star \". The executive overhears the song and wants to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church's mortgage. With everything settled, O'Malley is transferred to a new assignment; O'Dowd will be Fitzgibbon's new assistant, with Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. However, the church is damaged by a massive fire. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a Mass that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a parting gesture, O'Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon's mother in Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings \"Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral\", as Father O'Malley quietly slips away into the night.",

    "plot": "On the battlements of Elsinore , in a flash-forward, the dead body of Hamlet is borne in state upon the shoulders of noble lords with Horatio in attendance mourning the dead Hamlet. The flash-forward dissolves and in the same location at a separate time, Francisco, a sentry, is relieved of his watch by another sentry, Bernardo, who, with yet another sentry, Marcellus, has twice previously seen the Ghost of King Hamlet. Marcellus then arrives with the sceptical Horatio, Prince Hamlet's friend. Suddenly, all three see the Ghost, and Horatio demands that the Ghost speak. The Ghost vanishes then, without a word. Inside the Great Hall of the castle, the court is celebrating the marriage of Gertrude and King Claudius ; old King Hamlet has died apparently of an accidental snakebite, and his wife, Gertrude, has, within a month of the tragedy, married the late King's brother. Prince Hamlet sits alone, refusing to join in the celebration, despite the protests of the new King. When the court has left the Great Hall, Hamlet fumes over the hasty marriage, muttering to himself the words \"and yet, within a month!\" Soon, Horatio and the sentries enter telling Hamlet of the ghostly apparition of his father. Hamlet proceeds to investigate, and upon arriving on the battlements, sees the Ghost. Noting that the Ghost beckons him forward, Hamlet follows it up onto a tower, wherein it reveals its identity as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. He tells Hamlet that he was murdered, who did it, and how it was done. Claudius poured poison into the late King Hamlet's ear, thereby killing him. Hamlet does not at first accept this as the truth, and then prepares to feign madness, so as to test Claudius' conscience, without jumping to conclusions. This feigned insanity attracts the attention of Polonius who is completely convinced that Hamlet has gone mad. Polonius pushes this point with the King, claiming that it is derived from Hamlet's love for Ophelia , Polonius's daughter. Claudius, however, is not fully convinced, and has Polonius set up a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet's \"madness\" is constant even in this exchange, and Claudius is convinced. Hamlet then hires a group of wandering stage performers, requesting that they enact the play The Murder of Gonzago for the king. However, Hamlet makes a few alterations to the play, so as to make it mirror the circumstances of the late King's murder. Claudius, unable to endure the play, calls out for light, and retires to his room. Hamlet is now convinced of Claudius' treachery. He finds Claudius alone, and has ample opportunity to kill the villain. However, at this time, Claudius is praying, and Hamlet does not seek to send him to heaven, so, he waits, and bides his time. He instead confronts Gertrude about the matter of his father's death and Claudius' treachery. During this confrontation, he hears a voice from the arras , and, believing that it was Claudius eavesdropping, plunges his dagger into the curtains. On discovering that he has in fact, killed the eavesdropping Polonius instead, Hamlet is only mildly upset, and he continues to confront his mother. He then sees the ghostly apparition of his father, and proceeds to converse with it. Gertrude, who cannot see the Ghost, becomes convinced that Hamlet is mad. Hamlet is deported to England by Claudius, who has given orders for him to be killed once he reaches there. Fortunately, Hamlet's ship is attacked by pirates, and he is returned to Denmark. In his absence, however, Ophelia goes mad over Hamlet's rejection and the idea that her own sweetheart has killed her father, and she drowns, supposedly committing suicide. Laertes , Ophelia's brother, is driven to avenge her death, as well as his father's. Claudius and Laertes learn of Hamlet's return and prepare to have him killed. However, they plan to make it look like an accident. Claudius orders Laertes to challenge Hamlet to a duel, wherein Laertes will be given a poisoned blade that will kill with a bare touch. In case Laertes is unable to hit Hamlet, Claudius also prepares a poisoned drink. Hamlet meets Laertes' challenge and engages him in a duel. Hamlet wins the first two rounds, and Gertrude drinks from the cup, suspecting that it is poisoned. Whilst in-between bouts, Laertes rushes Hamlet and strikes him on the arm, fatally poisoning him. Hamlet, not knowing this, continues to duel. Hamlet eventually disarms Laertes and switches blades with him. Hamlet then strikes Laertes in the wrist, fatally wounding him. Gertrude then submits to the poison and dies, warning Hamlet not to drink from the cup. Laertes, dying, confesses the whole plot to Hamlet, who flies at Claudius in a fit of rage, killing him, then dies. Horatio, horrified by all this, orders that Hamlet be given a decent funeral, and the young prince's body is taken away while the Danish court kneels and the cannons of Elsinore fire off a peal of ordnance in respect.",

The scene then shifts back in time to the same location, where a guard on duty is relieved by another guard. This second guard, along with a third guard, has previously witnessed the apparition of the deceased king. The third guard then arrives with the prince's skeptical friend. Suddenly, all three see the ghostly figure, and the friend demands it speak. The apparition vanishes without uttering a word. Inside the great hall of the castle, the court celebrates the marriage of the queen and the new king. The old king died apparently from an accidental poisonous bite, and his widow married his brother within a month of his death. The young prince sits alone, refusing to celebrate despite the new king's protests. After the court departs, the prince broods over the hasty marriage. Soon, his friend and the guards tell him about the ghostly apparition. The prince investigates and encounters the ghost on the battlements. The ghost beckons him to follow, leading him to a tower where it reveals itself as his father's spirit. It tells the prince he was murdered by the new king, who poured poison into his ear while he slept. The prince does not immediately accept this as truth and decides to feign madness to test the new king's conscience. This pretended insanity attracts the attention of the chief counselor, who becomes convinced the prince has gone mad. The counselor tells the king that the madness stems from the prince's love for his daughter. The king, however, remains unconvinced and has the counselor arrange a meeting between the prince and the daughter. The prince maintains his \"madness\" during this encounter, which convinces the king. The prince then hires traveling performers, requesting they perform a play for the king. He alters the play to mirror the circumstances of his father's murder. Unable to endure the performance, the king calls for light and retires to his chambers. Now convinced of the king's treachery, the prince finds him alone and has the opportunity to kill him. However, the king is praying, and the prince does not want to send him to heaven, so he waits. Instead, he confronts his mother about his father's death and the king's treachery. During this confrontation, he hears a noise behind a curtain and, believing the king is eavesdropping, stabs through the fabric. He discovers he has killed the counselor instead. He remains only mildly disturbed and continues confronting his mother. He then sees his father's ghost again and speaks with it. His mother, unable to see the apparition, becomes convinced her son is mad. The king sends the prince to a foreign country with orders for his execution upon arrival. Fortunately, the prince's ship is attacked by pirates, and he returns home. In his absence, the counselor's daughter goes mad over the prince's rejection and the fact that he killed her father. She drowns, apparently by suicide. Her brother is driven to avenge both deaths. The king and the brother learn of the prince's return and plot to kill him while making it appear accidental. The king orders the brother to challenge the prince to a duel, providing him with a poisoned blade that will kill with a mere scratch. As a backup plan, the king also prepares a poisoned drink. The prince accepts the challenge and duels the brother. The prince wins the first two rounds, and the queen drinks from the cup, suspecting it is poisoned. Between rounds, the brother rushes the prince and strikes his arm, fatally poisoning him. Unaware of this, the prince continues fighting. He eventually disarms his opponent and switches blades with him, then strikes the brother in the wrist, fatally wounding him.

    "plot": "After the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, Julius Caesar goes to Egypt , under the pretext of being named the executor of the will of the father of the young Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII and his older sister and co-ruler, Cleopatra . Ptolemy and Cleopatra are in the midst of their own civil war, and she has been driven out of the city of Alexandria . Ptolemy rules alone under the care of his three \"guardians\": the chief eunuch Pothinus, his tutor Theodotus and General Achillas. Cleopatra convinces Caesar to restore her throne from Ptolemy. Caesar, in effective control of the kingdom, sentences Pothinus to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and banishes Ptolemy to the eastern desert, where he and his outnumbered army would face certain death against Mithridates . Cleopatra is crowned queen of Egypt and begins to dream of ruling the world with Caesar, who in turn desires to become king of Rome . They marry, and when their son Caesarion is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the Senate . After being made dictator for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king. On the Ides of March in 44 BC, a group of conspirators assassinate Caesar and flee the city, starting a rebellion. An alliance among Octavian (Caesar's adopted son), Mark Antony (Caesar's right-hand man and general) and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus puts down the rebellion and splits the republic. Cleopatra is angered after Caesar's will recognizes Octavian, rather than Caesarion, as his official heir and returns to Egypt. While planning a campaign against Parthia in the east, Antony realizes that he needs money and supplies that only Egypt can sufficiently provide. After repeatedly refusing to leave Egypt, Cleopatra acquiesces and meets him on her royal barge in Tarsus . The two begin a love affair. Octavian's removal of Lepidus forces Antony to return to Rome, where he marries Octavian's sister Octavia to prevent political conflict. This enrages Cleopatra. Antony and Cleopatra reconcile and marry, with Antony divorcing Octavia. Octavian, incensed, reads Antony's will to the Roman senate, revealing that Antony wishes to be buried in Egypt. Rome turns against Antony, and Octavian's call for war against Egypt receives a rapturous response. The war is decided at the naval Battle of Actium on September 2, 31 BC, where Octavian's fleet, under the command of Agrippa , defeats the lead ships of the Antony-Egyptian fleet. Assuming Antony is dead, Cleopatra orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows her, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated. Months later, Cleopatra sends Caesarion under disguise out of Alexandria. She also convinces Antony to resume command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing armies. However, Antony's soldiers abandon him during the night. Rufio , the last man loyal to Antony, kills himself. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is eventually forced to flee into the city. When Antony returns to the palace, Apollodorus , who was in love with Cleopatra himself, tells him she is in her tomb as she had instructed, and lets Antony believe she is dead. Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then confesses that he lied to Antony and assists him to the tomb where Cleopatra and two servants had taken refuge. Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms. Octavian and his army march into Alexandria with Caesarion's dead body in a wagon. He discovers the dead body of Apollodorus, who had poisoned himself. He then receives word that Antony is dead and Cleopatra is holed up in a tomb. There he offers to allow her to rule Egypt as a Roman province if she accompanies him to Rome. Cleopatra, knowing that her son is dead, agrees to Octavian's terms, including a pledge on the life of her son not to harm herself. After Octavian departs, she orders for her servants to assist with her suicide. Discovering that she was going to kill herself, Octavian and his guards burst into Cleopatra's chamber to find her dead, dressed in gold, along with her servants and the asp that killed her.",

    "plot": "In 1926 China during its Warlord Era , Navy Machinist's Mate First Class Jake Holman transfers to the Yangtze River Patrol gunboat USS San Pablo as their new engineer. Almost immediately, he upsets the crew when he will not accept the coolies they use to do most of their duties. Instead, Holman takes personal responsibility of the engine room. He befriends a seasoned sailor named Frenchy. After an engine malfunction caused by a problem Holman noticed, but the captain refused to repair, the chief Chinese engine-room worker dies. Lop-eye Shing, leader of all the Chinese workers onboard, blames Holman. The captain tells Holman he must find a Chinese replacement, so he chooses the simple but genial Po-han. The sailors on shore leave visit a bar and brothel run by a former sailor. A high-priced virgin named Maily captivates the crew. Frenchy discovers that her price is the debt she must pay to get her freedom. Holman's nemesis Stawski conspires with Shing to get Po-han kicked off the boat, in response Holman proposes a boxing match; if Stawski wins, he gets the money needed for Maily, but if he loses, Po-han keeps his job. Stawski is almost beaten when the alarm sounds, forcing the crew to rush back to their boat, but Holman forces the ten count to finish. A Chinese mob has been angered that British warships have fought a battle with Chinese warlords on the Yangtze River. When the Chinese Civil War begins, the San Pablo is ordered to remain neutral, while rescuing stranded Americans up river. Po-han is sent ashore by Shing while the sailors collect Jameson, a missionary, and Shirley Eckert, his schoolteacher assistant. After being caught by a mob, Holman violates the captain's orders to stay neutral by shooting Po-han to end his brutal death on shore.

    "obfuscated_plot": "In 1926 during a period of regional military conflict in an Asian country, a naval engineer transfers to a river patrol gunboat as their new mechanic. Almost immediately, he upsets the crew when he will not accept the local workers they use to do most of their duties. Instead, the engineer takes personal responsibility of the engine room. He befriends a seasoned sailor. After an engine malfunction caused by a problem the engineer noticed, but the captain refused to repair, the chief local engine-room worker dies. The leader of all the local workers onboard blames the engineer. The captain tells the engineer he must find a replacement, so he chooses a simple but genial local man. The sailors on shore leave visit a bar and brothel run by a former sailor. A high-priced virgin captivates the crew. The seasoned sailor discovers that her price is the debt she must pay to get her freedom. The engineer's nemesis conspires with the workers' leader to get the new hire kicked off the boat, in response the engineer proposes a boxing match; if his nemesis wins, he gets the money needed for the woman, but if he loses, the new hire keeps his job. The nemesis is almost beaten when the alarm sounds, forcing the crew to rush back to their boat, but the engineer forces the ten count to finish. A local mob has been angered that foreign warships have fought a battle with regional warlords on the river. When a civil war begins, the gunboat is ordered to remain neutral, while rescuing stranded foreigners up river.

    "plot": "Set in the mid through late 19th century, the film depicts Émile Zola's early friendship with Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne and his rise to fame through his prolific writing. It also explores his involvement late in the Dreyfus affair . In 1862 Paris, struggling writer Zola shares a drafty Paris attic with Cézanne. His fiancée Alexandrine procures him a desk clerk job at a bookshop, but he is soon fired after he arouses the ire of his employer and an agent of police with his provocative novel The Confessions of Claude . He then witnesses many injustices in French society, such as a crowded river slum, unlawful mining conditions and corruption in the army and government. Finally, a chance encounter with a street prostitute hiding from a police raid inspires his first bestseller, Nana , an exposé of the steamy underside of Parisian life. Despite the chief censor's pleading, Zola writes other successful books such as The Downfall , a scathing denunciation of the French commanders' blunders and disunity that led to a disastrous defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. He becomes rich and famous, marries Alexandrine and settles down to a comfortable life in his mansion. One day, his old friend Cézanne, still poor and unknown, visits him before leaving the city.

As World War II looms, Vin returns from university and meets Carol Beldon, granddaughter of Lady Beldon from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements, they fall in love. As the war comes closer to home, Vin enlists in the Royal Air Force , qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near his parents' home and can signal his safe return from operations to his parents by \"blipping\" his engine briefly as he flies over the house. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the Starling , to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation . Early one morning, Kay wanders down to the landing stage and discovers a wounded German pilot hiding in her garden. He takes her to the house at gunpoint, where she feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try to convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen and short engagement. Kay reminds her that she, too, had been young when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat. Carol marries Vin, becoming another Mrs. Miniver even though  she fears Vin is likely to be killed in action. During an air raid, Kay and her family take refuge in their Anderson shelter in the garden and attempt to keep their minds off the bombing by reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . They narrowly survive as a bomb destroys part of the house. Vin and Carol return from their honeymoon in Scotland and see the damage to the house, but Kay has arranged Vin's room for them. At the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner. Instead, she announces the rose entered by the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard, named the \"Mrs. Miniver\" as the winner, with her own Beldon Rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron.

The son proposes to the young woman in front of his family at home. Together with other boat owners, the husband volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in a major wartime evacuation. Early one morning, the wife wanders down to the landing stage and discovers a wounded enemy pilot hiding in her garden. He takes her to the house at gunpoint, where she feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and calls the police. Soon after, the husband returns home, exhausted, from the evacuation. The titled lady visits the wife to try to convince her to talk her son out of marrying the granddaughter on account of the young woman's comparative youth at age eighteen and short engagement. The wife reminds her that she, too, had been young when she married her late husband. The titled lady concedes defeat. The young woman marries the son, becoming part of the family even though she fears he is likely to be killed in action. During an air raid, the wife and her family take refuge in their shelter in the garden and attempt to keep their minds off the bombing by reading a children's book. They narrowly survive as a bomb destroys part of the house. The son and his new bride return from their honeymoon in the northern part of the country and see the damage to the house, but the wife has arranged a room for them. At the annual village flower show, the titled lady disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner. Instead, she announces the rose entered by the local stationmaster, named after the wife, as the winner, with her own rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of the estate hall, the wife and the young bride drive the son to join his squadron. On their journey home, they see an enemy plane lose a dogfight and crash. Immediately afterwards, two fighters duel at treetop level. Realizing the young bride has been wounded by machine-gun fire from the planes, the wife takes her back to their home, where she dies. The villagers assemble at the bomb-damaged church where their clergyman affirms their determination in a sermon. The titled lady stands alone in her family's church pew. The son moves to stand alongside her, united in grief, as the members of the congregation sing a hymn. Meanwhile, visible through the holes in the roof, air force fighters in victory formations depart to face the enemy."

    "plot": "In a mansion called Xanadu , part of a vast palatial estate in Florida , the elderly Charles Foster Kane is on his deathbed. Holding a snow globe , he utters his last word, \"Rosebud\", and dies. A newsreel obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher and industry magnate. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of \"Rosebud\". Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an alcoholic nightclub owner, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns about Kane's rise from a Colorado boarding house and the decline of his fortune. In 1871, gold was discovered through a mining deed belonging to Kane's mother, Mary Kane. She hired Thatcher to establish a trust that would provide for Kane's education and assume guardianship of him, protecting him from his brutal father. While the parents and Thatcher discussed arrangements inside the boarding house, the young Kane played happily with a sled in the snow outside. When his parents introduced him to Thatcher and told him he would live with him, the boy struck Thatcher with his sled and attempted to run away. By the time Kane gained control of his trust at the age of 25, the mine's productivity and Thatcher's prudent investing had made Kane one of the richest men in the world. Kane took control of the New York Inquirer newspaper and embarked on a career of yellow journalism , publishing scandalous articles that attacked Thatcher's (and his own) business interests. Kane sold his newspaper empire to Thatcher after the 1929 stock market crash left him short of cash. Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls that Kane hired the best journalists available to build the Inquirer ' s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the Spanish–American War and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of the President of the United States. Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a retirement home . Leland says that Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrated over the years, despite their having a son, and he began an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while running for Governor of New York as a \"fighting liberal\". His political opponent, corrupt boss Jim W. Gettys, discovered the affair and forced Susan to write to Emily about it; and the public scandal ended Kane's political career. Kane married Susan and forced her into a humiliating career as an opera singer (for which she had neither talent nor ambition). Kane then built a large opera house in Chicago for Susan to perform in. After Leland began to write a negative review of Susan's disastrous opera debut, Kane fired him but finished the negative review and printed it. Susan protested that she never wanted the opera career anyway, but Kane forced her to continue the season. Susan consents to an interview with Thompson and describes the aftermath of her opera career. She attempted suicide, and Kane finally allowed her to abandon singing. After many unhappy years living at Xanadu with Kane, the two had an argument that culminated in Kane slapping Susan. Susan decided to leave Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan moved out of Xanadu, Kane began violently destroying the contents of her former bedroom. When Kane discovered a snow globe, he calmed down and tearfully said \"Rosebud\". Thompson concludes that he cannot solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will remain unknown. At Xanadu, Kane's belongings are cataloged or discarded by the mansion's staff as Thompson leaves. They find a sled, the one on which eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day he was taken from his home in Colorado, and throw it into a furnace with other items. Unknown to the staff, the sled's trade name, printed on top, becomes visible through the flames: \"Rosebud\". The sled's smoke rises from the chimney as the view pulls back to a sign on Xanadu's outer fence which also began the film: \"No Trespassing\".",

It is gradually revealed that Cassie quit medical school after the public rape of her lifelong best friend, Nina Fisher, who subsequently dropped out and committed suicide when her rapist, Al Monroe, was cleared of wrongdoing. Cassie becomes reacquainted with Ryan Cooper, a former medical school classmate, who persuades her to go on a date. Ryan reveals that Al will soon get married. Angered that he has found success and happiness, Cassie begins to orchestrate revenge against the people that she thinks contributed to nobody being held accountable for the rape. First, Cassie meets with Madison McPhee, another former classmate and onetime friend of hers and Nina's, who blames Nina for her own assault because she often drank to excess. Cassie plies Madison with wine and hires a man to take her to a hotel room to trick her into thinking she was raped. Afterward, Madison leaves Cassie multiple distressed voicemails. Cassie then targets Elizabeth Walker, the dean who dismissed Nina's case. Pretending to be a makeup artist for a popular band, she lures Walker's daughter into her car. She meets with Walker under the guise of returning to medical school and finds that the dean only vaguely remembers Nina's case. She even had Al return to give a talk at the school recently.

He uses soap bars only once to wash his hands, paper towels to touch public restroom faucets and door handles, avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks, has rituals with switches and locks, sticks to rigid routines, and always eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant while bringing his own plastic flatware. Carol Connelly is the only server at the restaurant who tolerates his rude and compulsive behavior. Melvin's apartment neighbor, gay artist Simon Bishop, starts working with a new model, Vincent Lopiano. Vincent uses the opportunity to case Simon's apartment and give entry to his friends, who assault and nearly kill Simon during the robbery. Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, intimidates Melvin into caring for Simon's pet dog Verdell, a Griffon Bruxellois , while Simon is hospitalized. Although Melvin initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, he becomes emotionally attached to it. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin tolerates a neighborly relationship with him so he can continue to see Verdell. Melvin's compulsive need for routine and aversion to change is aggravated when Carol decides to work closer to home in Brooklyn to be more accessible for her acutely asthmatic son, Spencer. Unable to adjust to a different waitress, Melvin arranges to pay for Spencer's considerable medical expenses for at-home care―if Carol returns to the restaurant. While Carol is overwhelmed by Melvin's generosity, thanking him profusely, she is suspicious of his motives, declaring emphatically that she will never have sex with him. A humiliated Melvin admonishes her that she, not he, has made the situation personal. Meanwhile, Simon's injuries, lack of medical insurance, and high medical bills cause him to go bankrupt and fall into depression. Frank persuades him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money. Bullied by Frank, Melvin reluctantly agrees to take a recuperating Simon to Baltimore. Frank lends Melvin his Saab 900 convertible for the trip. Irrationally fearing Simon may make a pass at him (his cover story), Melvin invites Carol along on the trip, reminding her that she owes him a favor, so she reluctantly accepts. Relationships develop among the three on the trip as Simon discusses the root of his estrangement with his parents, who cannot accept his homosexuality; Carol commiserates; and Melvin's acerbic remarks gradually become more sympathetic. Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out for dinner. His conversation during the dinner initially flatters her—he tells her that her \"no-sex oath\" made him start taking medication to become a better man. When Carol presses Melvin to admit that he invited her on the trip because he has feelings for her, an embarrassed and fumbling Melvin again clumsily deflects. He awkwardly responds that he invited her along to maybe have sex with Simon to cure his homosexuality. Upset at the implication that her sexual favors are for sale, Carol abruptly leaves. Going to Simon's hotel room for consolation, perhaps their emotional intimacy rekindles his creative desire to paint. He sketches Carol, nearly nude, making her feel her femininity appreciated in a non-sexual way. With confidence inspired by Carol, Simon briefly reconnects with his mother, without asking her for money, telling her that he will be fine. After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin she does not want him in her life anymore as he disparages her. Since Simon is still broke and his apartment has been sublet, Melvin arranges for him to stay in his spare bedroom. On learning of Melvin's enormous gesture and sign of growth, Carol regrets her harshness and apologizes to Melvin by phone. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon persuades insomniac Melvin to declare his love for her. At 4 am, Melvin goes to see Carol, who hesitantly agrees to try establishing a relationship with him. She is encouraged by her mother, who declares that no relationship is perfect. As Melvin opens the door for Carol at a pastry shop, he realizes that he has stepped on a pavement crack to no apparent unease. They walk into the shop conversing as a couple.",

Rachel is shocked and runs home and then begins to avoid Calla. Nick Kazlik, Rachel's high-school classmate who now teaches at an inner city school in the Bronx , arrives for a short visit. Nick's first appearance in the film happens in a flashback to Rachel's childhood, when he and Rachel talked right after his dead twin brother was carried into Rachel's father's funeral home in a basket. Upon first seeing the adult Rachel many years later, Nick makes a crude pass that Rachel rebuffs, but after the episode with Calla, she succumbs to his charms and has her first sexual experience. Mistaking lust for love, she begins to plan a future with Nick, who tries to rebuff her gently by showing her a photo of a young boy who looks exactly like him that Rachel thinks is his son. Through a telephone call to Nick's mother, Rachel later discovers that he never married. The child in the photograph who looked exactly like Nick must have been Nick's twin brother, and he must have carried the loss with him into adulthood, perhaps keeping him from having close relationships. Believing that she is pregnant, Rachel plans to leave town and raise the child. With Calla's assistance, she finds a teaching job in Oregon, but before the summer ends, she learns, to her great disappointment, that she is not pregnant and that her symptoms are the result of a benign cyst. After undergoing surgery to have the cyst removed, Rachel tells her mother that she is moving to Oregon (where her sister lives with her husband and children), and that her mother may accompany her if she wishes. Her mother reluctantly agrees to accompany her. Rachel sets out with hope for the future, having learned that she has choices, that she is able to give and receive sexual pleasure, and that it is possible for her to actively embrace life rather than waiting for it to find her. On the bus ride she fantasizes about walking along the beach holding the hand of a young child.",

Wary of pirate activity off the coast of the Horn of Africa , he and First Officer Shane Murphy order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out a practice drill. During the drill, the captain notices that the vessel is being followed by Somali pirates in two skiffs , and calls for help. Knowing that the pirates are listening to radio traffic, he pretends to call a warship, requesting immediate air support. One skiff turns around in response, and the other – crewed by four armed pirates led by Abduwali Muse – loses engine power trying to steer through Maersk Alabama ' s wake. The next day, Muse's skiff, now fitted with two outboard engines, returns with the same four pirates aboard. Despite the efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates secure their ladder to the ship. As they board, Phillips tells the crew to hide in the engine room, just before the pirates storm the bridge and hold Phillips and the other crew members at gunpoint. Phillips offers Muse the $30,000 in the ship's safe, but Muse's orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Shane sees that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals and tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry deactivates the power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a lifeboat . However, Muse's right-hand man Nour Najee refuses to board the lifeboat with Muse unless Phillips goes with them. Once all are on the lifeboat, Najee attacks Phillips, forcing him into the vessel before launching the boat with all five of them on board. As the lifeboat heads for Somalia, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the plant-based stimulant khat that they have been chewing, and they lose contact with their mother ship . Najee becomes agitated and begins to question Muse's leadership when they are intercepted by the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Bainbridge . Bainbridge ' s captain Frank Castellano is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the Somali coast by any means. Even when additional ships arrive, Muse asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. The negotiators are unable to change his mind, and a team from DEVGRU parachutes in to intervene, while Phillips attempts to escape from the lifeboat before being quickly recaptured and repeatedly beaten by Najee. While three DEVGRU marksmen get into positions, Castellano and DEVGRU continue to try to find a peaceful solution, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Muse agrees to board Bainbridge , where he is told that his clan elders are arriving to negotiate Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips prepares a goodbye letter to his wife in case he is killed, while Najee decides to take full control. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and snatches it. Phillips attacks Najee until Bilal subdues him by striking him in the back with his gun. The pirates tie up and blindfold Phillips, and Najee beats him further. As Najee prepares to shoot Phillips, Bainbridge ' s crew stops the tow, causing Elmi, Bilal, and Najee to lose balance.

On September 11, 2001 , schools close early, so Oskar arrives home alone to find six answering machine messages left by his father from the World Trade Center . He hides under his bed, where his grandmother finds him and stays until Linda returns. Oskar is angry at his father's funeral, especially as the casket is empty, unable to make sense of his death. A year later, Oskar has a secret hiding place with memories of his father, including the answering machine with its messages. In his father's room, he accidentally shatters a vase, and inside finds a key in an envelope with the word \"Black\" on it. He becomes obsessed with finding the lock the key fits, believing it a clue from his father. Oskar finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book, so plans to visit each one. He lies to his mother, with whom he is becoming increasingly distant, about his outings. He first meets Abby Black, who is in the starting process of a divorce, but she tells Oskar she did not know his father. Further encounters continue to be fruitless, but he meets a variety of people, photographing and recording notes on each one in a scrapbook. One day, Oskar ventures into his grandmother's apartment, but instead of finding her there, encounters the reclusive elderly renter that has been living there, whom his grandmother had warned him to avoid. The renter does not speak, communicating instead with the words \"yes\" and \"no\" tattooed on his hands and a writing pad. Oskar confides in him, and the man offers to accompany Oskar on his outings. As they explore the city together, Oskar learns to face his fears, such as those of public transport and bridges. Eventually, he concludes that the stranger is his grandfather. Oskar plays the increasingly desperate answering machine recordings for him, but the man becomes agitated. He refuses to listen to the final one, and tells Oskar to stop his search. Later, Oskar sees him arguing with his grandmother and packing to leave, so angrily tries to confront him as his taxi pulls away, saying he knows he is his long-estranged grandfather. Oskar then notices a phone number for an estate sale circled on the back of a newspaper clipping of his father's. When he dials the number, he reaches a surprised Abby, who takes Oskar to meet her ex-husband William. William realizes that Oskar's key is the one he has been looking for, which had been left to him in the vase by his own now deceased father, unbeknownst to him when he gave away the vase to Thomas at the estate sale. Oskar confides to William that on the day of the attacks, he was home when the phone rang a sixth time, but was too afraid to answer. After witnessing the tower collapse on TV as the phone call cut off, he bought a replacement answering machine so his mother would never find out. He leaves the key with William, but runs away from Abby, distraught. Back in his room, Oskar proceeds to destroy the material from his search, until his mother reveals to him that she had been aware of all his outings, and had gone ahead of him to meet all the Blacks to prepare them for his visit. Finally realizing how much his mother cares about him, he accepts his father's death and writes letters to all the people he met to thank them for their kindness.

On his way to visit O'Shaughnessy later that evening, Spade is followed by a young man but manages to evade him. When he tells O'Shaughnessy about Cairo, her nervousness indicates she knows him. He arranges a meeting between the two at his apartment, where Cairo becomes agitated when O'Shaughnessy reveals that the \"Fat Man\" is in San Francisco. When Spade goes to Cairo's hotel in the morning, he spots Wilmer Cook, the young man who trailed him earlier. Wilmer works for Kasper Gutman, the \"Fat Man\". In his hotel suite, Gutman relates the history of the Maltese Falcon , then offers Spade his pick of either $25,000 for the statuette and another $25,000 after its sale, or a quarter of the proceeds from its sale. Spade passes out because his drink is spiked. Wilmer and Cairo come in from another room and leave with Gutman. On coming round, Spade searches the suite and finds a newspaper with the arrival time of the freighter La Paloma circled. He goes to the dock, only to find the ship on fire. Later, the ship's captain Jacoby is shot several times and staggers into Spade's office before dying. The bundle he was clutching contains the Maltese Falcon. O'Shaughnessy calls the office, gives an address, then screams before the line goes dead. Spade stashes the package at the bus terminal, then goes to the address, which turns out to be an empty lot. Spade returns home to discover O'Shaughnessy hiding in a doorway. He takes her inside and finds Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer waiting for him, guns drawn. Gutman gives Spade $10,000 for the Falcon, but Spade tells them that part of his price is someone he can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacoby, suggesting Wilmer. After some intense negotiation, Gutman and Cairo agree and Wilmer is knocked out and disarmed. Just after dawn, Spade calls his secretary, Effie Perine, to bring him the bundle. However, when Gutman inspects the statuette, he finds it is a fake. Cairo lashes out at Gutman, and Wilmer escapes during the tumult. Recovering his composure, Gutman invites Cairo to return with him to Istanbul to continue their quest. After they leave, Spade calls the police and tells them where to pick up the pair. Spade then angrily confronts O'Shaughnessy, telling her he knows she killed Archer to implicate Thursby, her unwanted accomplice. She confesses, but begs Spade not to turn her over to the police. Despite his feelings for her, Spade gives O'Shaughnessy up. He submits the statuette as evidence, describing it as \"the stuff that dreams are made of\".",

He is accompanied by Miep Gies and Mr. Kraler , his Christian employees who shielded the Jewish Frank family and 4 others. When Otto searches for the diary kept by his youngest daughter, Anne , Miep promptly retrieves it for him. In July 1942, Anne writes of the restrictions placed on Jews that drove the Franks into hiding over their spice factory. Sharing the Franks' hiding place are the Van Daans and their teenage son, Peter. Kraler and Miep have conspired with Otto to prepare the hideaway. Those hiding are warned to maintain strict silence during daylight while workers are present. Kraler delivers food and a box for Anne, compiled by Otto, containing her beloved movie star photos and a blank diary. As months pass, Anne teases Peter, whose only attachment is to his cat, Mouschi. Otto teaches Anne and her sister, Margot , while Petronella Van Daan passes the time reminiscing of her youth. The strain of confinement causes the Van Daans to argue and pits Anne against her mother, Edith . Kraler brings a radio that provides news of the world. Conditions are growing more dire, with Jews suddenly disappearing, shipped to concentration camps. Kraler asks them to take in another person, Miep's Jewish dentist named Albert Dussel , who confirms that many of their friends have disappeared. Dreaming of one of her friends in a concentration camp, Ann wakes up screaming. In October 1942, news comes of the Allied landing in Africa, and the bombing of Amsterdam intensifies. During Hanukkah , Van Daan abruptly announces that Peter must get rid of Mouschi, who consumes too much food. Their argument is cut short when they hear a prowler break in the front door; the room falls silent until Peter crashes into an object while trying to catch Mouschi. The startled thief grabs a typewriter and flees. A watchman summons police officers, who search the premises, but on hearing Mouschi voice a sound, they are reassured the noise was caused by a stray cat and leave. In January 1944, Anne begins to attract Peter's attention, and Miep brings the group a luxurious cake. Van Daan asks Miep to sell Petronella's fur coat so he can buy cigarettes. Kraler warns that one of the employees asked for a raise after implying that something strange is going on in the attic. Dussel dourly comments that it is just a matter of time before they are discovered. Blaming the adults for the war that has destroyed all hope, Anne storms out of the room; Peter follows to comfort her. Anne confides her dreams of becoming a writer, and Peter voices frustration over his inability to join the war effort. Catching Van Daan trying to steal bread, Edith denounces him, ordering his family to leave. As Dussel and Mrs. Van Daan quarrel over food, word comes over the radio of the Allied invasion of France , and Van Daan breaks into tears of shame. Heartened by the news, everyone apologizes for their harsh words. Anne dreams of being back in school by autumn. By July 1944 the invasion bogs down, and Kraler is hospitalized with ulcers. The police have found the stolen typewriter, and Anne muses that her diary provides a way to live on after death. The Van Daans resume quarrelling, and Peter declares he cannot tolerate the situation. Anne soothes him by reminding him of the goodness of those who have come to their aid. The sirens of an approaching police van interrupt their conversation. Certain of impending arrest, they kiss. As the German police break open the bookcase entrance, Otto declares they no longer live in fear, but can go forward in hope.

    "plot": "Charlie Barber, a successful theater director in New York City with his own theater company, is helming a play that stars, as usual, his wife of ten years, Nicole, who is a former teenage movie actress. The couple is experiencing marital troubles and sees a mediator, who suggests they each write down what they love about one another, but Nicole is too embarrassed to read hers aloud, and they decide to forgo counseling. When Nicole is offered a starring role in a television pilot in Los Angeles, she decides to leave Charlie's company and go to live with her mother in West Hollywood , taking their son, Henry, with her. Thinking the separation will only be temporary, Charlie remains in New York, as his play is moving to Broadway . Despite the couple agreeing to split amicably and forgo lawyers, Nicole—encouraged by her producer—hires Nora Fanshaw, a high-profile family lawyer, who gets Nicole to open up about how she gradually felt neglected by Charlie and how he rejects her ideas and desires. Nicole also suspects that Charlie slept with Mary Ann, his stage manager. Excited by the news that he has won a MacArthur Fellowship grant, Charlie visits Nicole's family in LA, and she serves him with divorce papers. He meets with Jay Marotta, a brash and expensive lawyer who urges Charlie to fight dirty, but Charlie returns to New York without hiring Jay. After receiving a phone call from Nora, who warns him to get a lawyer soon or risk losing custody of Henry, Charlie returns to LA and hires Bert Spitz, an empathetic older lawyer who favors a civil and conciliatory approach. On Halloween, which Charlie spends in LA, Henry mentions to Charlie that Nicole wants to stay in California permanently. Charlie calls Nicole and angrily interrogates her, and Nicole reveals she hacked his emails and found proof of his affair with Mary Ann. Bert counsels Charlie to rent an apartment in LA to strengthen his custody case. To avoid going to court, Bert and Charlie meet with Nora and Nicole. Nora says Charlie refused to respect Nicole's wishes to move back to LA and claims Henry would prefer to stay with his mother rather than fly back and forth between coasts. Bert advises Charlie to give in on this point, but Charlie does not want to be separated from his son, so he fires Bert. Using the first installment of his fellowship grant, Charlie hires Jay. In court, Nora and Jay argue aggressively on behalf of their clients, leading to a series of character assassinations . Nora highlights Charlie's emotional distance and past infidelity, while Jay exaggerates Nicole's drinking habits and threatens criminal action for hacking Charlie's emails. Meanwhile, Nicole and Charlie try to remain friendly out of court and share time with Henry, who is increasingly annoyed by the back-and-forth. Disillusioned with the legal process, the couple decide to meet in private, but their good intentions do not keep the discussion from escalating dangerously. Nicole scathingly claims that Charlie has now fully merged with his own selfishness, and Charlie confesses that he wishes Nicole was dead. Charlie breaks down in tears and apologizes, and Nicole comforts him. Shortly after their argument, they reach an agreement and finalize the divorce. However, Nora negotiates slightly better terms for Nicole behind her back, causing Nicole to feel uncomfortable. The following Halloween, Charlie again comes to LA. He learns Nicole has a new boyfriend and is nominated for an Emmy Award for directing an episode of her television series. He informs her that he has taken a residency at UCLA and will therefore be living in LA for a while. While everyone is changing into their costumes, Charlie discovers Henry reading the list of things Nicole loves about Charlie that she wrote during mediation. Henry asks Charlie to read the rest aloud to him, and Charlie does so, becoming emotional as Nicole, unnoticed, watches from the doorway. After trick-or-treating, Nicole offers to let Charlie take Henry home, even though it is her night. She notices Charlie's shoe is untied, and, as his arms are full carrying Henry, ties it for him before he leaves.",

    "plot": "The story is set in New York City in the 1890s . A bawdy singer, Lady Lou, works in the Bowery barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan, who has given her many diamonds. But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine. What she does not know is that Gus traffics in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to San Francisco to be pickpockets. Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff. One of Gus's rivals and former \"friend\" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn, spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail. Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him. A city mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, Captain Cummings, is in reality an undercover federal agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers. Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark, is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer. Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly  as she walks down the cellblock. Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend. Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number. After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death. Lou calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark. She has her bodyguard Spider, who \"would do anything for you, Lou\" dispose of Rita's body. She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings \" Frankie and Johnny \", she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun. Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as \"The Hawk\", a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei. Chick, still lurking in Lou's room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him. Cummings then takes Lou away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the paddywagon into which all the other criminals have been loaded.

    "plot": "In 1947, John Nash arrives at Princeton University as a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the Carnegie Scholarship for Mathematics. He meets fellow math and science graduate students Sol, Ainsley, and Bender, and his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student. Determined to publish an original idea of his own, Nash is inspired when he and his classmates discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success, which leads him to develop a new concept of governing dynamics . His theory earns him an appointment at MIT where he chooses Sol and Bender over Hansen to join him. In 1953, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to decipher encrypted enemy telecommunications. Bored with his work at MIT, he is recruited by the mysterious William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense with a classified assignment: to identify hidden patterns in magazines and newspapers to thwart a Soviet plot. He is given an implanted diode that gives him a passcode to access a drop spot at a mansion. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive with his work and grows paranoid. Nash falls in love with a student, Alicia Larde , and they eventually marry. After a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, Nash tries to quit his assignment but is forced to continue. While delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University , Nash believes Soviet agents are pursuing him and is forcibly sedated. He awakens to a psychiatric facility under the care of Dr. Rosen. Dr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee (niece of Charles), and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia, Sol and Bender investigate her husband's study, which shows various news and magazine clippings. Alicia uncovers the stack of unopened \"classified documents\" from the drop point and brings them to Nash, revealing the truth of his assignment. Overcome with shock, Nash slices his arm open to uncover the diode, which doesn't exist. Nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy and eventually released. Frustrated with the side effects of his antipsychotic medication, he secretly stops taking it. He encounters Parcher, who urges him to continue his assignment in a shed near his home. In 1956, Alicia discovers Nash has relapsed and rushes home. She finds that Nash had left their infant son in the running bathtub, convinced \"Charles\" was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash accidentally hits her and the baby, believing he's saving them from Parcher. As Alicia flees with the baby, Nash realizes that all of them have looked the same ever since he first encountered them, in particular that \"Marcee\" has always remained a young girl, and concludes they must be hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash chooses not to be hospitalized again, believing he can deal with his symptoms himself with Alicia's support. Nash returns to Princeton, approaching his old rival Hansen, now head of the mathematics department , who allows him to work out of the library and audit classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations and, by the late 1970s, is allowed to teach again. In 1994, Nash is awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on game theory and is honored by his fellow professors. At the Stockholm ceremony, he dedicates the prize to his wife. Nash reencounters Charles, Marcee, and Parcher after the ceremony, but ignores them as he, Alicia, and their son leave.",

He falls in love with a student and they marry. After witnessing a shootout between the agent and enemy operatives, he tries to quit but is forced to continue. While delivering a guest lecture at another university, he believes enemy agents are pursuing him and is forcibly sedated. He awakens in a psychiatric facility under a doctor's care. The doctor tells his wife that the mathematician has a mental illness and that his roommate, the roommate's young niece, and the government agent exist only in his imagination. His wife and colleagues investigate his study and discover unopened documents. His wife reveals the truth to him, and he attempts to locate the implanted device, which doesn't exist. He undergoes treatment and is eventually released. Frustrated with medication side effects, he secretly stops taking it and encounters the hallucinated agent again. In 1956, his wife discovers he has relapsed after finding he had left their infant son unattended, convinced his imaginary roommate was watching the child. During a crisis, he accidentally strikes his wife and baby, believing he's protecting them. His wife flees, and he realizes his hallucinations haven't aged over the years. He chooses to manage his symptoms without hospitalization with his wife's support. He returns to the university, approaching his former rival, now department head, who allows him to work in the library. Over the next two decades, he learns to ignore his hallucinations and is eventually allowed to teach again. In 1994, he is awarded a major prize for his theoretical work and is honored by his colleagues. At the ceremony, he dedicates the prize to his wife. He encounters his hallucinations after the ceremony but ignores them as he leaves with his family."

    "plot": "In 1961 London, Jenny Mellor is a bright and attractive 16-year-old schoolgirl who aspires to attend the University of Oxford . Her studies are controlled by her strict father, Jack. After youth orchestra rehearsals, Jenny waits at a bus stop on the street in heavy rain when David Goldman, an older man, stops his Bristol 405 and tells her that he is a music lover and is worried about her cello getting wet. He persuades Jenny to put her cello in his car while she walks alongside. As the rain becomes heavier, Jenny asks David if she can sit inside the car. The two talk about music and, before being dropped off, Jenny confides that she is looking forward to attending university and being able to live a life of culture, doing things such as going to art galleries and watching French films. The following week, David has flowers delivered to Jenny's house, wishing her luck at her youth orchestra's concert. Later, she sees him in town and approaches him. David asks Jenny if she is free to go and see a concert and have supper with him and his friends. She happily agrees and thanks him. On the night of the concert, Jack disapproves of Jenny going, but when David comes by to pick up Jenny, he easily charms Jack into letting him take Jenny and bring her home later than her normal curfew. Arriving at the concert, Jenny meets David's friends, Danny and Helen. Afterwards, they go to dinner at a fancy restaurant with live music much to Jenny's liking. Finding she is also interested in art, they invite Jenny to an art auction. David picks up Jenny at school and they go to the auction, winning a bid for a painting by Edward Burne-Jones and going to Danny's place afterwards. They talk about Oxford and all agree to go and visit together the following weekend. Jenny hears a commotion late one night and sees David drinking with her parents. He then uses the opportunity to ask them if he can take Jenny to Oxford, saying that he used to study there and would like to visit his old teacher, Clive Lewis , the author of The Chronicles of Narnia . Her parents are reluctant at first, but agree, seeing it as a good opportunity. At Oxford, Jenny discovers that David makes his money through a variety of shady practices, and although initially shocked succumbs to David's persuasive talk. Back outside her home, Jenny and David have their first kiss. Jenny then shows a signed copy of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to her parents (in fact, she had seen David sign it, and they had never met Lewis). Impressed by David's apparent connections and charisma, Jack and Marjorie approve of their romantic relationship. On the night of Jenny's 17th birthday, David arrives with presents and tells her parents that he intends to take them all to Paris as a special birthday gift. Her father demurs, but following a conversation with David agrees to Jenny going with him alone. In Paris, the two go sight-seeing, take photos, and go dancing, and Jenny loses her virginity to David. Back in London, Jenny gives her favourite teacher, Miss Stubbs, Chanel perfume as a gift from her trip, but Miss Stubbs refuses the gift, telling Jenny that she knows where it came from and is both concerned and disapproving of her relationship with David. They argue and have a falling-out. Later that night, David proposes marriage. After talking with her parents, Jenny accepts the proposal, but the news causes an argument with her headmistress, and she decides to drop out of school and not pursue a place at university. While getting petrol on their way to a celebration dinner with her parents, Jenny looks in the car's glove compartment for a cigarette and discovers, through letters, that David is already married. Shocked, Jenny tells David to take her and her parents back home. Jenny tearfully argues with David, telling him she gave up her education to be with him. David says he will get a divorce and agrees that he will tell her parents the truth with her, but after she goes inside her house, he drives off and is never seen again. Jenny despairs, and goes to see Danny and Helen, blaming them for not telling her the truth early on. She also blames her parents for encouraging her to throw her life away with an older man. Jenny goes to see David's wife, who tells her that David is a serial adulterer, and has a son. Later that night, Jack apologizes to Jenny, admitting that he messed up and that he believed David could give her the life she wanted. Jack points out that although David wasn't who he said he was, Jenny had also deceived her parents about David's nature by playing along with some of David's lies to her parents. When Jenny is then refused re-admission to her old school to repeat her last year and take her exams, she goes to Miss Stubbs, apologising and asking for her help. Miss Stubbs eagerly agrees, and Jenny resumes her studies and is accepted at Oxford the following year. In a closing voiceover, Jenny shares a story about dating boys her age and starting over with fresh eyes, despite her experience with David.",

Ed meets his daughter-in-law, Beth, with whom he has a strained relationship, and they argue over politics. Ed blames his son and daughter-in-law's radical political views for Charlie's disappearance, while Beth blames the American government. Ed leverages his connections to meet with various government officials to uncover the truth about his son's vanishing. As he investigates, Ed discovers that the American embassy is not as helpful as he expected and suspects them of concealing information about Charlie. One U.S. diplomat is polite and friendly but consistently lies to him; a high-ranking American military attaché is blunt and tells Ed that whatever happened to Charlie was his own fault, stating, \"You play with fire, you get burned.\" Together, he and Beth learn that the U.S. had many interests in the country that were enhanced by the coup and its aftermath, and that many military officials aided Pinochet in the coup. As Ed becomes disillusioned with the American government, he comes to respect the work Beth and Charlie were doing, and he and Beth reconcile. When they receive proof that Charlie was murdered by the junta and that the U.S. allowed it to happen, he tells the embassy officials, \"I just thank God we live in a country where we can still put people like you in jail!\" The film concludes with a postscript stating that, after Ed's return to the United States, he received Charlie's body seven months later, making an autopsy impossible, and that a subsequent lawsuit against the U.S. government was dismissed.

    "name": "The Dresser",
    "plot": "The plot is based on Harwood's experiences as dresser to English Shakespearean actor-manager Sir Donald Wolfit , who is the model for the character \"Sir\". The film opens with a performance of Othello at a regional theatre in Britain during World War II . In the title role is an aging, once-famous Shakespearean actor identified to us only as \"Sir\". He is of the old, bombastic school of British acting, full of grand gestures and fine oratory. As the curtain comes down on the last act, and as the actors line up for their curtain call, Sir lectures them on the mistakes they've made during the performance, showing us that he is the leader of this travelling band of actors bringing Shakespeare to the provinces during wartime. Waiting backstage is Norman, who has been Sir's dresser for decades. Norman is an efficient, somewhat effeminate man who knows Sir's every whim and fancy, is used to his tirades and temperamental rants and is, for all intents and purposes, Sir's servant. As Norman waits for Sir to come offstage after a typically florid closing address to the audience, we see one way he copes with his job as he takes a nip from a little bottle of brandy always in his back pocket. The company is hurrying to its next venue, the industrial city of Bradford , where Sir is to give his renowned portrayal of the title character in King Lear . The train nearly leaves without them, as Sir makes his stately progress through York railway station to the platform, Norman scurrying ahead to plead with the train guard to hold the train for Sir's arrival. But the train begins to pull out of the station, until Sir delivers a loud, commanding \"STOP....THAT....TRAIN!\" from the platform steps. The guard is taken aback, the train halts, and Sir placidly leads his company aboard. Arriving in Bradford, however, another source of Norman's anxiety soon becomes clear, for it becomes obvious that Sir's mental capacities are rapidly fading. Norman rescues him from a confused, almost violent rant in Halifax town square near Piece Hall that lands Sir in hospital. As the company tries to decide what to do, Sir unexpectedly arrives at the theatre, disoriented and exhausted, saying he has discharged himself from hospital. Norman ushers Sir to the dressing room, fiercely resisting the stage manager's insistence that the show be cancelled, and insisting Sir will be ready to go on. The middle section of the film takes place nearly entirely in the dressing room, as Norman struggles to prepare Sir for the curtain. Sir's wandering mind and nearly incoherent ramblings gradually become more focused as Norman gets him to concentrate on applying his makeup, remembering his lines; and we see how dependent the two men are on each other. Sir would have no career left without Norman; Norman, even worse, would have no life without Sir, to whom he has so long dedicated all his time and energy. By the time Sir's wife, referred to only as \"Her Ladyship\", who is playing Cordelia to her husband's Lear, arrives in the dressing room for the five-minute call, Sir is ready for the role he has performed 227 times. The curtain rises for the opening dialogue among Lear's courtiers, but Sir seems to mentally drift away while waiting for his cue, much to Norman's distress, forcing the hapless actors on stage to improvise speeches while Norman struggles to convince Sir of his entrance. Air raid sirens sound, signalling the onset of an air raid; and, indeed, distant bombs that can be heard falling seem to rouse Sir and he strides on stage to deliver what all agree is his finest portrayal of Lear in his long career. After the triumphant performance, however, Sir collapses from exhaustion and Norman helps him to his dressing room to lie down. Sir requests that Norman read from an autobiography he claims to have been writing. Although all Sir has written is the opening dedication, Norman reads aloud Sir's gracious \"thank you\"s to his audiences, his fellow actors, to Shakespeare, to stage technicians...but not a word about his dresser who has served him so long and loyally. About to protest, Norman discovers that Sir has died while he's been reading. Norman, by now slightly drunk from the evening's brandy nips, flies into a rage, accusing Sir of being a thankless old sod, and in his anger even madly scribbles an addition to Sir's writing thanking himself. But Norman's anger only temporarily covers his disorientation at losing the only life he has known for so many years and, as Norman tearfully admits, the only man he has ever loved. The film closes with Norman sprawled across Sir's body, unwilling to let go of his life and his love.",

    "plot": "Lydia Tár is chief conductor of a Berlin orchestra. She heavily relies on Francesca, her personal assistant and confidant. While being interviewed by Adam Gopnik at The New Yorker Festival , Lydia promotes her upcoming live recording of Mahler's Fifth Symphony and memoir Tár on Tár . She meets with Eliot Kaplan, an investment banker and amateur conductor who co-founded the Accordion Foundation with Lydia to support aspiring female conductors. They discuss technique, replacing Lydia's assistant conductor Sebastian with Francesca, and filling a vacant cello position in Berlin. As a guest lecturer, Lydia holds a masterclass at Juilliard . When a student expresses reluctance to study J. S. Bach 's works due to his regressive social views, she encourages the class to focus on the music and the composer's contributions rather than his personal life. The debate escalates and ends with the student swearing at her before leaving the class. Later that night, Lydia anonymously receives a first edition of Vita Sackville-West 's novel Challenge . The title page has been embellished with a handdrawn kené pattern, a personal reminder of her trip to Perú. She tears up the page and throws it away. Lydia flies back to Berlin where she lives with her wife Sharon, the concertmaster of the orchestra, and their adopted daughter Petra. Before a blind audition for the cello position, Lydia spots a young Russian candidate, Olga Metkina, in the bathroom. Lydia changes her scorecard to ensure Olga a spot in the orchestra and grants her a soloist position in the companion piece, Elgar's Cello Concerto . Lydia's attraction to Olga causes her relationships with Francesca and Sharon to grow strained. Krista Taylor, a promising young musician who Lydia once mentored, has been blacklisted after getting on Lydia's bad side. After sending disturbing emails to Francesca, Krista commits suicide. Lydia instructs Francesca to delete the emails and retain a lawyer after learning Krista's parents plan to file suit against her. Lydia informs Sebastian of his imminent replacement. Incensed, he indicates the orchestra is aware of her favoritism and that it suggests inappropriate behavior. Due to Sebastian's accusations, Lydia decides not to promote Francesca to assistant conductor. Lydia is haunted by an increasing sensitivity to sound , vivid surreal nightmares, daytime hallucinations, chronic pain, and enigmatic patterned scribbles resembling those Krista once made. While trying to complete a composition dedicated to Petra, she is disturbed by the sound of a medical device next door, where her neighbor is caring for her dying mother. One day, Lydia falls and hurts herself while attempting to follow Olga home, but she tells Sharon she was injured in a mugging. A manipulatively edited cellphone video of Lydia's Juilliard class goes viral, and an article accusing her of sexual predation appears in the New York Post . Lydia tries to reach Francesca, who resigned after being passed for assistant conductor. She breaks into Francesca's home to find that it is completely empty aside from a draft of Tár on Tár , which Francesca renamed Rat on Rat . Lydia, accompanied by Olga, returns to New York City to attend the deposition in the lawsuit of Krista's parents and to promote her book; the two are met by protestors, and Lydia is confronted with incriminating emails between her and Krista that Francesca provided for the deposition. In Berlin, Lydia is removed as conductor due to the controversy. Furious over the allegations and Lydia's lack of transparency, Sharon bars her from seeing their daughter. Lydia retreats to her old studio and grows increasingly depressed and deranged. She sneaks into the live recording she was supposed to conduct and tackles Eliot, who replaced her as conductor. Advised to lie low by her management agency, she returns to her modest childhood home on Staten Island , where certificates of achievement adorn the wall bearing her birth name, Linda Tarr.

    "obfuscated_plot": "A woman serves as chief conductor of a major European orchestra. She heavily relies on her personal assistant and confidant. While being interviewed at a prestigious cultural festival in a large American city, she promotes her upcoming live recording of a classical symphony and her memoir. She meets with an investment banker and amateur conductor who co-founded an arts foundation with her to support aspiring female conductors. They discuss technique, replacing her assistant conductor with her personal assistant, and filling a vacant position in the orchestra. As a guest lecturer, she holds a masterclass at a renowned music conservatory. When a student expresses reluctance to study a famous composer's works due to his regressive social views, she encourages the class to focus on the music rather than the composer's personal life. The debate escalates and ends with the student swearing at her before leaving the class. Later that night, she anonymously receives a first edition of a novel. The title page has been embellished with a hand-drawn pattern, a personal reminder of her trip to a South American country. She tears up the page and throws it away. She flies back to the European city where she lives with her wife, the concertmaster of the orchestra, and their adopted daughter. Before a blind audition for the vacant position, she spots a young Eastern European candidate in the bathroom. She changes her scorecard to ensure the candidate a spot in the orchestra and grants her a soloist position in a companion piece. Her attraction to the young musician causes her relationships with her assistant and her wife to grow strained. A promising young musician she once mentored has been blacklisted after getting on her bad side. After sending disturbing emails to the assistant, the young musician commits suicide. She instructs her assistant to delete the emails and retain a lawyer after learning the deceased musician's parents plan to file suit against her. She informs her assistant conductor of his imminent replacement. Incensed, he indicates the orchestra is aware of her favoritism and that it suggests inappropriate behavior. Due to his accusations, she decides not to promote her personal assistant to assistant conductor. She is haunted by an increasing sensitivity to sound, vivid surreal nightmares, daytime hallucinations, chronic pain, and enigmatic patterned scribbles resembling those the deceased musician once made. While trying to complete a composition dedicated to her daughter, she is disturbed by the sound of a medical device next door, where her neighbor is caring for her dying mother. One day, she falls and hurts herself while attempting to follow the young soloist home, but she tells her wife she was injured in a mugging. A manipulatively edited cellphone video of her masterclass goes viral, and an article accusing her of sexual predation appears in a major tabloid. She tries to reach her assistant, who resigned after being passed for assistant conductor. She breaks into her assistant's home to find that it is completely empty aside from a draft of her memoir, which the assistant has mockingly retitled. She, accompanied by the young soloist, returns to the large American city to attend the deposition in the lawsuit and to promote her book; the two are met by protestors, and she is confronted with incriminating emails that her former assistant provided for the deposition. In the European city, she is removed as conductor due to the controversy. Furious over the allegations and her lack of transparency, her wife bars her from seeing their daughter. She retreats to her old studio and grows increasingly depressed and deranged. She sneaks into the live recording she was supposed to conduct and tackles the person who replaced her as conductor. Advised to lie low by her management agency, she returns to her modest childhood home in a working-class neighborhood, where certificates of achievement adorn the wall bearing her birth name. She tears up watching an old video recording of a famous conductor's educational program discussing the meaning of music. Her brother arrives and admonishes her for forgetting her roots. She finds work conducting in a Southeast Asian country. Seeking a massage, the hotel concierge sends her to a brothel fronting as a massage parlor; the young women sit in a semicircle with numbers on their robes. When one woman looks directly at her, she rushes outside to vomit. Later on, she conducts a live performance of a video game score in front of an audience of fans in costume."

    "plot": "In 1936, American archaeologist Indiana Jones recovers a Golden Idol from a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. Rival archaeologist René Belloq corners him and steals the idol; Jones escapes in a waiting float plane . After returning to the United States , Jones is briefed by two Army Intelligence agents that Nazi German forces are excavating at Tanis , Egypt , and one of their telegrams mentions Jones's former mentor Abner Ravenwood. He deduces that the Nazis are seeking the Ark of the Covenant , which Adolf Hitler believes will make their army invincible. The agents recruit Jones to recover the Ark first. At a bar in Nepal , Jones reunites with Abner's daughter Marion , with whom Jones once had an illicit relationship, and learns that Abner is dead. The bar is set ablaze during a scuffle with Gestapo agent Arnold Toht , who arrives to take a medallion from Marion. Toht attempts to recover the medallion from the flames, but only burns its image into his hand. Jones and Marion safely take the medallion and escape. Traveling to Cairo , the pair meet Jones's friend Sallah . He reveals Belloq is assisting the Nazis, who have fashioned an incomplete replica medallion from the burns on Toht's hand. Nazi soldiers and mercenaries attack Jones, and Marion is seemingly killed, leaving Jones despondent. An imam deciphers the medallion for Jones, revealing that one side bears a warning against disturbing the Ark, and the other bears the complete measurements for the \"staff of Ra \", an item which, when combined with the medallion, is used to locate the Ark. Jones and Sallah realize that the Nazis are digging in the wrong location, infiltrate the Nazi dig site, and use the medallion and the correctly sized staff of Ra to locate the Well of Souls, the Ark's resting place. The pair recover the Ark, a golden, intricately decorated chest, but Belloq and the Nazis discover them and seize it. Jones and Marion, whom Belloq has been holding captive, are sealed inside the well, but the pair escape and Jones captures a truck carrying the Ark. Alongside Marion, Jones arranges to transport the Ark to London aboard a tramp steamer . A German U-boat intercepts them, seizing the Ark and Marion; Jones covertly boards the U-boat. The vessel travels to an island in the Aegean Sea , where Belloq intends to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. On the island, Jones ambushes the Nazi group and threatens to destroy the Ark but surrenders after Belloq deduces that he would never destroy something so historically significant, also surmising that Jones wants to know if the Ark's power is real. The Nazis restrain Jones and Marion at the testing site as Belloq ceremonially opens the Ark but finds only sand inside. At Jones's instruction, he and Marion close their eyes to avoid looking at the opened Ark, as it releases spirits, flames, and bolts of energy that kill Belloq, Toht, and the assembled Nazis before sealing itself shut. Jones and Marion open their eyes to find the area cleared of bodies and their bindings removed. Back in Washington, D.C. , the United States government rewards Jones for securing the Ark. Despite Jones's insistence, the agents state only that the Ark has been moved to an undisclosed location for \"top men\" to study. In a vast warehouse, the Ark is crated up and stored among countless other crates.",

Ten years later, by chance, Anthony is apprenticed to Bonnyfeather, who discovers his relationship to the boy but keeps it a secret.

    "plot": "During a 1978 funeral service in London in honour of the life of Harold Abrahams , headed by his former colleague Lord Andrew Lindsay, there is a flashback to when he was young and in a group of athletes running along a beach. In 1919, Harold Abrahams enters the University of Cambridge , where he experiences antisemitism but enjoys participating in the Gilbert and Sullivan club. He becomes the first person to complete the Trinity Great Court Run , running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil Gordon , a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano. Eric Liddell , born in China to Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running. Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but Sam Mussabini , a professional trainer he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters, who assert that it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for antisemitic and class-based prejudice. When Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running and that not to run would be to dishonour God. After years training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams's Cambridge friends, Andrew Lindsay, Aubrey Montague , and Henry Stallard . While boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. Despite intense pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic Committee , he refuses to run the race on the Lord's Day . A solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the 400 metres hurdles , offers his place in the 400-metre race on the following Thursday to Liddell. Liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world; he delivers a sermon at the Paris Church of Scotland that Sunday. Abrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200-metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race and wins. His coach Mussabini, who was barred from the stadium, is overcome that the years' dedication and training have paid off.

    "obfuscated_plot": "During a funeral service in a European capital city in honor of a renowned athlete, headed by his former colleague, there is a flashback to when he was young and in a group of athletes running along a beach. In the early 20th century, a young university student enters a prestigious university, where he experiences discrimination but enjoys participating in a theater club. He becomes the first person to complete a challenging collegiate run, running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading theater soprano. Another athlete, born in a foreign country to missionary parents, is in his home country. His devout sister disapproves of his plans to pursue competitive running. He sees running as a way of glorifying his religious beliefs before returning to work as a missionary. When they first race against each other, the second athlete beats the first. The first athlete takes it poorly, but a professional trainer he had approached earlier offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the university college masters, who assert that it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. The first athlete dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for prejudice. When the second athlete accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. He tells her that though he intends to return eventually to his missionary work, he feels divinely inspired when running and that not to run would be to dishonour God. After years of training and racing, the two athletes are accepted to represent their country in an international Olympic competition. Also accepted are the first athlete's university friends. While boarding the boat to the competition, the second athlete discovers the heats for his race will be on a religious day of rest. Despite intense pressure from national leaders and the Olympic Committee, he refuses to run the race on that day. A solution is found thanks to his teammate, who offers his place in another race. The second athlete's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world; he delivers a sermon at a local church that day. The first athlete is badly beaten by heavily favoured foreign runners in one race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be another race. He competes and wins. His coach, who was barred from the stadium, is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off. Now he can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend, whom he has neglected for the sake of running. The second athlete defeats the foreign favorites in his race and wins the gold medal. The team returns home triumphant. An epilogue reveals that the first athlete married his girlfriend and became a respected figure in athletics, while the second athlete went on to do missionary work and was mourned by his countrymen following his death in a war-torn region."

Lewis is an avid outdoorsman and survivalist who leads the group, and Ed has been on several trips but lacks Lewis's ego, while Bobby and Drew are novices. En route to their launch site, the men, in particular Bobby, are rude toward the locals, who are hostile to the \"city boys\". At a local gas station, Drew, with his guitar, engages a young banjo-playing boy in a musical duel. The duel is mutually enjoyable, and some of the locals break into dance at the sound of it. However, the boy does not acknowledge Drew when prompted for a friendly handshake. The four friends travel in pairs and their two canoes become separated. Ed and Bobby encounter a pair of mountain men emerging from the woods, one carrying a shotgun and missing his two front teeth. Following an argument, Bobby is forced by the men to undress and the unarmed man rapes him, demanding he \"squeal like a pig\", while Ed is tied to a tree and held at gunpoint. Lewis sneaks up and kills the rapist with his bow and arrow while Ed snatches the shotgun from the other mountain man, who flees into the woods. After a heated debate between Lewis and Drew, Ed and Bobby vote to side with Lewis' plan to bury the body and continue on as if nothing had happened. The four continue downriver but the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew falls into the water. The canoes collide on the rocks, throwing the three remaining men into the river and smashing one of the canoes. Lewis breaks his thigh bone and the other two are washed ashore alongside him in a gorge. Lewis, who believes Drew fell out of the boat because he was shot, encourages Ed to climb to the top of the gorge and ambush the other mountain man, whom they believe to be stalking them from above. Ed reaches an overhang and hides out until morning, when a man appears above him and aims a rifle at him; a panicked Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, but falls backwards and lands on one of his own arrows. Ed worries that he has killed the wrong man when he inspects the body to find that the man has all of his teeth, but he then realizes the man is wearing dentures. Ed and Bobby weigh down the man's body in the river to ensure it will never be found, then do the same to Drew's body when they encounter it downriver shortly after. Upon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Ed and Bobby take Lewis to the hospital. The three carefully concoct a cover story for local authorities about Drew's death, lying about their adventure to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. Their cover is almost blown when Ed thinks he has overheard Bobby secretly telling the sheriff the truth, but Bobby convinces him otherwise. Ed and Bobby visit Lewis in the hospital, where Lewis is being watched over by a police officer. A worried Ed whispers to Lewis that they need to change their cover story, but Lewis relaxes him by pretending that he has no memory of what happened after they fell off the canoes due to head trauma. Sheriff Bullard does not believe the men and reveals that Deputy Queen is suspicious of them because his brother-in-law went hunting a few days ago and has not returned. However, he has no evidence to arrest them, and instead tells them never to do \"this kind of thing again\" and to never come back to the area.

Upon arriving at his quarters, the housekeeper warns him that their last priest prematurely aged while there. His duties include overseeing a nun-run, run-down inner-city school. The first time Father O'Malley has been responsible for a school, he's nervous he must address the large group of nuns. While he's trying to make some opening remarks, they continually giggle which disconcerts him. Finally he discovers a playful kitten was upstaging him. Getting a tour by Sister Superior Mary Benedict, O'Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities. However, the sisters feel that God will provide for them and put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus, a businessman who has constructed a modern building next door to the school on land he had bought from them. They are hoping he will donate it to them. Father O'Malley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Benedict both wish to save the school, but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. The Father has admitted eighth-grade student, Patsy of Syracuse, New York, whom the parish has taken in while her mother attempts to get back on her feet. He is told that, although she had been married to the father, the musician had gone to Cincinnati but broke his promise to send for her. When Patsy falls behind, Benedict questions O'Malley, concerned about her background. Respecting the mother's privacy, he deflects her questions. They have another clash involving student Eddie, who is being bullied by another, newer student. Concerned, the former tomboy although at first teaching the children to turn the other cheek, decides to teach him boxing from a manual. The Father \"coaches\" Patsy to be original in a paper for Sister Benedict, earning her a high mark. When the bully next trips Eddie, the Sister coaches from the sidelines, and not only does he hold his own, but he makes peace and offers friendship to him. They plant a seed of an idea to Mr. Bogardus. After being shown around the building, they point out that his donation of the building to the school would be his great legacy. Later, when he gets worked up over another costly delay, his doctor points out the stress is bad for his heart. Father O'Malley surprises Patsy's mother with a reunion with her estranged husband. He found him via the musicians' union, as he's a musician. They reconcile, surprising Patsy when she sees them kiss, who had come to show her mother her graduation dress. At her exams, Patsy is upset. The Father visits Sister Benedict, who tells him her marks are too low to pass. When he tries to convince her to pass her anyway, they butt heads. He points out the self-esteem issues that come with failing and talks about a very successful business owner in town who had had difficulties at school. Mr. Bogardus, convinced by his doctor that doing so will prolong his life, starts to do selfless acts. He gives a blind beggar money, helps an older woman to get on the bus, adopts a homeless dog and ultimately gives the sisters his building for the school. Patsy is finally introduced to the man she had seen kissing her mother, her father. She admits to sister Benedict that she intentionally failed her exams so she could be held back a year and stay with Sister Benedict. Patsy demonstrates knowing the material that was on the exam. Knowing this, Sister Benedict allows Patsy to graduate. Preparations are being made with getting the new building set, and Sister Benedict enthusiastically oversees setting up the new facility. Unfortunately, Father O'Malley has to break the news that her placement has changed. As Sister Benedict contracted tuberculosis , the physician recommends to Father O'Malley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason. She assumes the transfer is because of her disagreements with O'Malley and struggles to understand the reasons for the path set out for her. Just before Sister Benedict departs, Father O'Malley reveals the true reason for her temporary transfer, and she then leaves happily, looking forward to her return.",

Henry has become obsessed with raising funds, to the detriment of his family life. His relationships with wife Julia and their young daughter Debby are strained by his focus on the cathedral. Everyone, except for Henry, is charmed by Dudley, even the non-religious Professor Wutheridge. When Dudley spends time cheering up Julia, though, an unexpected development occurs: he finds himself strongly attracted to her. Sensing this, Henry becomes jealous and anxious for his now unwelcome guest to finish and depart. He reveals Dudley's true identity to Professor Wutheridge, who urges him to stand up and fight for the woman he loves. Dudley persuades a wealthy parishioner, the widowed Agnes Hamilton, to contribute her much needed funds, but not to build the cathedral, as Henry had hoped. Instead, he coaxes Mrs. Hamilton to donate her money to feed and clothe the needy, much to Henry's chagrin. On several occasions throughout the film, Dudley is shown to have special powers as an angel . He helps Julia and Sylvester (a taxi driver) ice skate like pros, redecorates the Broughams' Christmas tree in seconds, saves an old church by restoring interest in the boys' choir, dictates to a typewriter to magically produce Henry's new sermon —without Henry's knowledge— and other smaller things.

A former medical doctor, Dolittle lives with a menagerie . The animals he kept in his home created havoc with his human patients who began to go elsewhere for their medical needs. His sister, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave. He chose the animals. Dolittle's talking macaw Polynesia can speak over 2,000 animal languages. She offered to teach Dolittle so he could become an animal doctor.

Dolittle is treating a horse for near-sightedness when its owner, magistrate General Bellowes, bursts in and accuses him of stealing the animal. Bellowes ends up getting chased away by skunks. His niece Emma Fairfax chides Dolittle for his rudeness and lack of compassion for humans. Dolittle expresses his contempt for Bellowes, who hunts foxes, and for her, who, he says, does absolutely nothing. She storms off. To help Dolittle earn money for his expedition, a friend sends him a pushmi-pullyu , a rare creature. Dolittle takes the pushmi-pullyu to a nearby circus , and it becomes the star attraction. Dolittle talks with Sophie, a sad seal that longs to return to her husband at the North Pole . He smuggles Sophie out of the circus, disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and throws her in the ocean. Fishermen witness this and have Dolittle arrested for murder. When he appears in court before Bellowes, Dolittle proves that he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes's dog and revealing details only Bellowes and the dog could know. Certain that he will be set free, he tells his friend Matthew Mugg to get ready to begin their expedition the next day. While he is acquitted on the murder charge, the vindictive Bellowes orders him committed to an insane asylum . Polynesia engineers Dolittle's escape during his transfer to the asylum by obtaining the cooperation of the police horses and dogs. Dolittle, Matthew, Matthew's young friend Tommy Stubbins and some animals set sail in search of the Snail.

It is decided by randomly pointing at a map that the crew will search for the Snail on Sea Star Island, a floating island off the western coast of Africa. Assisted by sea creatures, they near Sea Star Island where they encounter a storm that destroys the Flounder . Everyone washes ashore on the Island. The party is soon captured by the island's natives who are highly-educated and cultured from reading books that have washed ashore after innumerable shipwrecks. The tribe blames newcomers for its misfortunes. The tropical island is drifting north into colder waters, which has given all of the animals colds. Dolittle tends to the animals and then persuades a whale to push the island south. The jolt causes a balancing rock to drop into a volcano, condemning Dolittle and his friends to be executed. Just as they are about to be killed, the island collides with Africa and the two pieces fit perfectly, confirming a legend that the Island had broken off from Africa 5,000 years earlier. For bringing them home, the natives cancel the execution and revere Dolittle as a god. A sneeze alerts Dolittle to the presence of the Snail, which lives in a cave on the island. In exchange for curing its cold, the Snail agrees to carry Dolittle's friends back to Britain in its watertight shell as it wants to visit its cousin the Loch Ness Monster anyway. Emma wishes to stay on the island with Dolittle and search for the Giant Lunar Moth, a creature that flies back and forth between Earth and the Moon, but he says he is not good with people. After saying that she will miss Dolittle, Emma kisses him goodbye.

The friends are deployed in northern France near La Malmaison , and are befriended by an older, experienced soldier named Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katczinsky. Their romanticism is shattered by the realities of trench warfare on the Western Front and Ludwig is killed by artillery the first night. On November 7, 1918, German State Secretary Matthias Erzberger tries to persuade the German High Command to begin armistice talks with the Allied powers . Behind the front in Champagne , Paul and Kat steal a goose to share with Albert, Franz, and another veteran, Tjaden Stackfleet. Kat, an illiterate, gets Paul to read a letter from his wife and worries that he'll be unable to reintegrate into society. Franz spends the night with a local French woman and keeps her scarf as a souvenir. On November 9, General Friedrichs, Erzberger and the German delegation arrive at a train bound for ceasefire negotiations at Compiègne . Paul's unit is sent to find 60 missing recruits and find they were killed by gas after taking their masks off too soon. Friedrichs opposes the armistice talks and orders an attack before French reinforcements arrive. That night, Erzberger's delegation reaches the Forest of Compiègne. On November 10, Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch gives the Germans 72 hours to accept the non-negotiable Allied terms. Paul's regiment is ordered into an assault, takes the French front line after savage hand-to-hand fighting, but is routed by a combined arms counterattack with Saint-Chamond tanks and flamethrowers . Franz is separated from the group and Albert is killed trying to surrender. Trapped in a crater in no man's land with a French soldier, Paul stabs him, then begs forgiveness after he dies slowly and painfully. Erzberger learns of Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication and is instructed by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg to accept the Allied terms. Paul's unit celebrates the war's imminent end and a wounded Tjaden gives him Franz's souvenir scarf. Tjaden, knowing his leg will be amputated, fatally stabs himself. On November 11, Erzberger's delegation signs an armistice set to take effect at 11:00 AM . Aware of the ceasefire, Paul and Kat raid a farm one last time, but Kat is shot by the farmer's son and dies before Paul can carry him to an infirmary. Friedrichs, wanting a successful battle before the war ends in defeat, sends Paul's unit into action at 10:45 AM. Paul kills many French soldiers before being bayoneted seconds before 11:00 AM. He dies as the fighting stops. A German replacement that Paul had earlier saved finds Paul's mud-caked body and picks up Franz's scarf, leaving behind the dog tag that will identify his body.",

    "plot": "The Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in their Midwestern city in the last few decades of the 19th century. As a young man, Eugene Morgan courts Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. She instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love, and spoils their child, George. The townspeople long to see George get his \"comeuppance.\" In the early 20th century, Major Amberson gives a large party at the Amberson Mansion for George, who is home from college for the holidays. Eugene, now a widower who has just returned to town after 20 years, attends. George dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber, and ridicules Eugene's investment in the automobile . He instantly takes to Eugene's daughter Lucy. The next day, George and Lucy take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene, George's aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack. Eugene's \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow, and George jeers at them to \"get a horse.\"  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene, after his vehicle is mobile again, gives everyone a ride back home. George is humiliated by the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel and his mother's obvious affection for Eugene. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments and soon dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene. Time passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy manufacturing automobiles, and again courts Isabel, who refuses to risk George's disapproval by telling him about their love. Lucy rejects George's marriage proposal by saying that he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are, and she leaves town. The Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner, where George, blaming him for turning Lucy against him, criticizes automobiles. The Ambersons are shocked by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from Aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. Enraged, he rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything that might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel and asks her to choose between her son and his love. Heartbroken due to her son's selfishness, Isabel nevertheless chooses George, thus destroying her chance for happiness. Lucy returns home to find that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints. Months pass, and Isabel is seriously ill, but George will not allow her to come home for fear that she will renew her relationship with Eugene. He relents only when she starts to die. George refuses to let Eugene go upstairs to visit Isabel on her deathbed although she begs to see Eugene one last time. After Isabel's death, Major Amberson sinks into senility and dies. His estate is worthless. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George intends to live on Fanny's income while he trains to be a lawyer, but she reveals that she lost everything in bad investments, and they are left with only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year. Eugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an American Indian chief who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George. Penniless, George gives up his job as a law clerk and finds higher paying work in a chemical factory, which gives him enough money for himself and Fanny to live on. George wanders the city and is dazed by the modern factories and slums, which have grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson mansion before it is sold, George prays by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see him receive his comeuppance. George is seriously injured by an automobile. Lucy and Eugene go to see him at the hospital and reconcile with him. In a hospital corridor, Eugene tells Fanny that Isabel's spirit had inspired Eugene to bring George \"under shelter again,\" which implies that his and Fanny's financial security was assured.",

    "year": "1961",
    "name": "Judgment at Nuremberg",
    "plot": "Judgment at Nuremberg centers on a military tribunal convened in Nuremberg , Germany , in which four German judges and prosecutors stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under the Nazi regime. Dan Haywood heads a panel of Allied jurists who will hear and decide the case against the defendants. Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning, a respected jurist and legal scholar, could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death. Haywood seeks to understand how the German people could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regime's crimes. In doing so, he befriends Frau Bertholt — the widow of a German general executed by the Allies — whose family home has been commandeered by the Americans and is serving as Haywood's residence during the trial. He talks with other Germans who have varying perspectives on the war. Other characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Harrison Byers, who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann, who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution's case against the judges. (Hoffman's character bears a resemblance to Irene Seiler, a key figure in the notorious Nazi kangaroo court case, the Katzenberger Trial .) German defense attorney Hans Rolfe argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis, such as US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. 's support for the first eugenics practices; the German- Vatican Reichskonkordat of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; Joseph Stalin 's part in the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany's invasion and occupation of western Poland , initiating World War II ; and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the final stage of the war in August 1945. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Meanwhile, as a strict constructionist jurist, Janning refuses to testify or participate in a legal proceeding that he profoundly feels is no better than a post-WWII Western kangaroo court of its own. As the proceeding becomes more and more intolerable to him, he dramatically breaks his silence. He chooses to testify before the Tribunal as a witness for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of condemning to death a Jewish man of \" blood defilement \" charges — namely, that the man had sex with a 16-year-old Gentile girl — when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. Janning explains that misled people such as him helped Adolf Hitler 's antisemitic , racist policies out of naive patriotism despite knowing it was wrong, and that all of Germany bears some measure of responsibility for the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime . Haywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency against his own ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the Berlin Blockade , and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union . [ 9 ] While the four defendants maintain their pleas of \"not guilty\" in their closing statements, Janning and fellow defendant, Werner Lampe, show clear remorse for their actions, while a third, Friedrich Hofstetter, claims they had no choice but to execute the laws handed down by Hitler's government. Only the fourth defendant, Emil Hahn, remains unrepentant, telling the Americans that they will live to regret not allying with the Nazis against the Soviet Union. Ultimately, all are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison . Rolfe goes to Haywood as he is departing Germany to inform him that Janning wishes him to visit, and he predicts that no defendant will stay in prison for more than 5 years. Haywood replies that Rolfe's position may be logical but without reverence for justice. Haywood places a phone call, but hangs up when it is unanswered. He receives his travel documents from Byers and tells him to give his best to his German girlfriend. Byers, responding that \"Americans aren't very popular in Nuremburg this morning,\" implies that they broke up in the wake of the verdicts. Haywood dials the phone once again; it's revealed he is trying to reach Frau Bertholt, who ignores the ringing phone with a tear in her eye. On his way out of Nuremburg, Haywood visits the prison. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that. Judge Haywood replies it came to that the first time Janning condemned a man he knew to be innocent. As Haywood is shown leaving the cell block, a title card informs the audience that, of 99 defendants sentenced to prison terms in Nuremberg trials that took place in the American Zone , none was still serving a sentence when the film was released in 1961.

However, Addie does not specify which woman's husband is involved. In flashbacks, each woman considers reasons why it might be hers. The first flashback involves Deborah, who was raised on a farm. Her first experience with the outside world came when she joined the Navy WAVES during World War II , where she met her future husband Brad. When they return to civilian life, Deborah does not feel welcome in Brad's sophisticated social circle, and is uncomfortable with her old-fashioned dress and overly curly hairdo as she prepares for her first country club dance. She over-imbibes at home to calm her nerves, but this backfires at the dance. Adding to her insecurity, she learns everyone expected Brad to marry Addie, a woman on whom all three husbands lavish their attention. Deborah is comforted by Brad's friend Rita, who writes stories for radio soap operas . Her husband George is a high school English teacher and enjoys inspiring his students. While Rita wishes George would be more ambitious, he is disappointed that Rita constantly caters to her boss, Mrs. Manleigh. Rita is so intent on pleasing Mrs. Manleigh that she invites the Manleighs for dinner and forgets George's birthday. George forgives Rita's mistake but, to his delight, a birthday gift of a rare Brahms recording arrives from Addie (piquing Rita's jealousy). When the Manleighs arrive, they are rude, accidentally break the Brahms record, and are miffed with George's sly critique of their beloved soaps. After they leave, George discovers Rita was hoping he would be hired at the radio station and is upset at his wife's attitude. Lora Mae grew up in poverty. She catches the eye of Porter, the older, divorced owner of a statewide chain of department stores where she works. Porter is attracted to Lora Mae and dates her a number of times, but is frustrated when she makes it clear she's holding out for marriage. Matters come to a head when Lora Mae sees a framed picture of Addie on the piano in Porter's mansion. Lora Mae says she wants her picture on the piano and his home to become hers. When Porter tells Lora Mae he's not interested in marriage, she ends the relationship. However, Porter skips a New Year's Eve party at Addie's to visit Lora Mae and grudgingly \"proposes\" (\"OK, OK, you win. I'll marry you. How about it?\") Lora Mae is less than thrilled, but kisses Porter regardless. Back in real time, the women return from the outing. Rita is overjoyed to find George at home - his mysterious disappearance was simply a trip to the school where he taught. He tells Rita he had been asked to direct the high school's dramatic society production of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\", and the first rehearsal was that day. He and Rita reconcile, and she vows to not allow herself to be at Mrs. Manleigh's mercy any longer. Porter is late coming home, causing Lora Mae to fear he has left with Addie. When he appears and hears his wife's suspicions, he accuses her of being happy at the thought of establishing grounds to divorce him and reap a big chunk of his fortune. Nevertheless, he grumpily agrees to accompany her to the country club dance as planned. When Deborah returns home, the houseboy hands her a message saying Brad called and will not return that night. Deborah is heartbroken at her perceived loss, but greets George and Rita glamorously dressed and coiffed and goes to the dance with them. At the couples' table, Porter complains about Lora Mae dancing with another man. Deborah says Porter has no idea how much Lora Mae really loves him. Porter scoffs, still certain Lora Mae sees him only as a money source. Unable to take the strain any longer, Deborah decides to leave, announcing to the group that Brad left with Addie. Porter stops her, confessing it was he who planned to flee with Addie, but changed his mind. As Deborah happily leaves for home, Porter tells Lora Mae that admitting his intended abandonment in front of witnesses (George and Rita) is enough for her to divorce him and take everything. To his shock, Lora Mae says, \"If you said something, I just didn't hear it.\" Finally convinced of her love, Porter is overjoyed. He asks her to dance and they kiss passionately, smiling at each other on the dance floor. The melancholy voice of the still unseen Addie Ross - left all alone -  bids the audience a good night.",

While working on a railroad, Allen receives assistance from Sebastian T. Yale, a powerfully built prisoner who damages Allen's shackles by hammering them with Allen's ankles still inside. The following Monday, while on a \"bathroom break,\" Allen slips out of his chains and runs. Armed guards and bloodhounds give chase, but Allen evades them by changing clothes and hiding at the bottom of a river. He makes it to a nearby town, where he is given money for a train ticket and a room for the night by one of Bomber's friends. Allen makes his way to Chicago , where he obtains a job as a manual laborer and uses his knowledge of engineering and construction to rise to a position of importance within a construction company. Along the way, he becomes romantically involved with his landlady, Marie Woods. Allen grows to loathe Marie, but she discovers his secret and blackmails him into an unhappy marriage. Trying to forget his troubles, he attends a high-society party at the invitation of his superiors and meets and falls in love with a younger woman named Helen. Marie betrays him to the authorities when he asks for a divorce. Allen describes the inhumane conditions of the chain gangs to the press, becoming national news. Many common citizens express their disgust with the chain gangs and their sympathy for a reformed man such as Allen, while editorials written by Southerners describe his continued freedom as a violation of \" state's rights .\" The governor of Illinois refuses to release Allen to the custody of the Southern state. Its officials offer Allen a deal: return voluntarily and receive a pardon after 90 days of easy clerical labor. Allen accepts, only to find the proposals were a ruse; he is sent to a chain gang, where he languishes for another year after being denied a pardon. Reunited with Bomber, Allen decides to escape once more. The two steal a dump truck loaded with dynamite from a work site. While leaning out of his seat to taunt pursuing guards, Bomber gets shot. He takes some of the dynamite, lights it, and throws it at a police car, causing a minor landslide. Shortly afterward, Bomber falls from the truck and dies, causing Allen to stop the vehicle. Allen then uses more dynamite to blow up a bridge he just crossed, allowing him to make a close escape. Allen makes his way north again, evading a relentless manhunt. Months later, he visits Helen in Chicago to wish her a permanent goodbye. Tearfully, she asks, \"Can't you tell me where you're going? Will you write?

    "plot": "César is a barkeeper in Marseille in the early 1920s. His 18-year-old son Marius works for him at his bar, but is obsessed with going to sea and leaving his boring existence behind. The only thing holding him back is Fanny, an 18-year-old girl with whom he grew up. Fanny works selling fish with her mother down at the waterfront. Fanny has been in love with Marius her whole life. She flirts with him, but Marius always rejects her. Fanny invites Marius to a Sunday-night dance, but he rejects her once more. Unbeknownst to Fanny, Marius is planning to leave the next day. Encouraged by his friend, the “Admiral”, he has secretly signed on as a sailor on a round-the-world scientific expedition. Offended by his rejection, Fanny leaves. Meanwhile, Panisse, an older merchant and a widower, asks to meet with Fanny's mother Honorine, who believes he wants to propose to her. To Honorine's surprise, Panisse wants to marry Fanny, even though he knows she loves someone else. Although disappointed, Honorine does not object: Panisse is worth 600,000 francs. Fanny tells Marius that she has rejected Panisse's proposal because she loves him and is willing to wait until he returns. Marius tells her he will be away for five years and to forget about him. They declare their love for each other and go to Fanny's house, where they sleep together. The following morning, Honorine discovers Fanny and Marius in bed together. She and César begin to plan their children's wedding, but Fanny urges Marius to leave and follow his heart. She even lies to him, telling him that she would rather marry a rich man like Panisse than him. But, in truth, she is afraid that, eventually, he will grow to hate her for depriving him of this great opportunity. About two months after Marius goes off to sea, Fanny discovers that she is pregnant with his child. She tells Panisse, who is happy to marry her anyway, overjoyed by the possibility of an heir to carry on his name. They marry, and Fanny gives birth to a boy. César, knowing the baby's true father, collaborates with Panisse to give the baby the name Césario Marius Panisse. On Césario's first birthday, Panisse takes the train to Paris on business. While he is gone, Marius returns, on a short leave. He visits Fanny and, upon learning her child is his, apologizes to Fanny.  He knows now that she said those things only to make him follow his passion for the sea. Marius tells her that he wants her back, but César comes in before anything can happen. Panisse arrives home early. Knowing that Fanny will not leave without the boy, he says that he will not try to stop Fanny from going with Marius, but he will not part with the child. Fanny tells Marius she loves him, but she will not take Césario from Panisse. Marius leaves without Fanny or his child. Ten years later, Césario is looking forward to his birthday party. After being taken to the waterfront, Césario wanders off and meets the Admiral. The Admiral takes the boy sailing without telling anyone and reunites him with Marius, though Césario has no idea who Marius is. Marius, who is now working in a garage, is overjoyed to see his son, but when Panisse is told the boy is missing, he is stricken and taken to his room. Fanny is shocked to find Césario with his father. She announces that Panisse is dying, and Marius drives them home. When they arrive at the house, Panisse calls for Césario to sit with him. Fanny goes outside and talks with Cesar and Marius. Marius expresses his bitterness and announces his plans to leave for the United States the next day. Fanny explains to Marius that she never told him about the baby because on the day he left, she hoped he would turn around and not get on the boat. When he did not, she felt betrayed and angry. Fanny goes to Panisse. On his deathbed, Panisse dictates a letter asking Marius to marry Fanny and be a father to Césario. His only request is that the boy keep the last name, Panisse.",

They plan to move to Nairobi , British East Africa , where Bror intends to invest Karen's money in a dairy farm. She will join him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, Karen's train is hailed by big-game hunter Denys Finch Hatton , who knows Bror and entrusts her with his ivory haul. Farah, the Somali headman Bror hired, greets Karen at the railway station. She is taken to the Muthaiga Club . She enters the men-only salon seeking her future husband, but is soon asked to leave. Karen and Bror immediately marry and become Baroness Blixen. Karen learns that Bror has changed their plan and instead bought a coffee farm, but it is at too high an elevation to be very productive. Karen needs Bror's help managing the farm, but he is more interested in guiding big-game hunting safaris. Karen comes to love Africa and its people. She looks after the Kikuyu people who live on her land, establishes a school there, helps with their medical needs, and arbitrates their disputes. Meanwhile, she attempts to build a formal European homelife equal to other nearby upper-class colonists. She befriends a young woman, Felicity (whose character is based on a young Beryl Markham ). Eventually, Karen and Bror's mutual feelings deepen, and they do consummate their marriage. However, Bror keeps pursuing other women, while Karen fills her evenings, socialising with neighbor visitors. As World War I reaches East Africa, the colonists form a militia led by colonial patriarch Lord Delamere , which includes Denys and Bror. A military expedition searches for forces from the neighbor German colony of German East Africa . Responding to the militia's need for supplies, Karen leads a tiring and long expedition to find them and returns safely. Karen contracts syphilis from Bror, returns to Denmark for treatment and recuperation while Bror manages the farm in her absence. Bror resumes his safari work upon Karen's return. They live separately after she discovers that he is still a philanderer. A relationship between Karen and Denys develops following an ambivalent kiss at a New Year's party, with their ultimately moving in with her in between his travels. Denys acquires a Gipsy Moth biplane and often takes Karen flying. After Bror expresses his desire to divorce and marry another rich woman, Karen asks Denys to solidify their relationship, but he prefers his autonomy and the status quo. When Karen learns Denys is taking Felicity on a private safari, she confronts him about his refusal to have monogamous relations. He assures Karen he only wants her, but feels marriage is immaterial. This eventually drives them apart. The farm eventually yields a good harvest, but a fire destroys it and the factory, forcing Karen to sell out. Before leaving Kenya for Denmark, she appeals to the incoming governor to provide land for her Kikuyu workers and sells most of her remaining possessions at a rummage sale . Denys visits the now-empty house. He says he no longer feels comfortable being alone and that his feelings for her have changed. He asks to join her on her journey back. Denys leaves for a safari scouting trip, promising to fly Karen to Mombasa when he returns. Shortly after, Bror arrives to inform Karen that Denys' plane has crashed in Tsavo . Karen organizes his funeral, during which she recites an excerpt from an A. E. Housman poem about a celebrated athlete who, like Denys, died young and was not destined to decline into old age. Before departing, Karen visits the Muthaiga Club to arrange for the forwarding of her mail. The members, having come to admire her, invite her into the men-only salon for a toast. Karen gives Farah a compass that Denys had given her and asks him to say her name so that she can hear his voice one last time. Sometime later, Farah writes to Karen, informing her that a pair of lions frequently visits Denys's grave.

Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York City by ship. In Brooklyn , police detectives Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle dressed as Santa Claus and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo stake out a bar known for drug trafficking. They later go out for drinks at the Copacabana . Popeye observes Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, a buyer in the narcotics underworld. Popeye learns that a shipment of heroin will arrive soon. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein. Devereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is in a hurry to make the purchase, but Weinstock urges patience, knowing they are being surveilled. Charnier realizes he is being surveilled as well, identifies Popeye as a detective, and escapes on a departing subway shuttle at Grand Central Station . To evade Popeye, he has Boca meet him in Washington, D.C. , where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier says Popeye would just be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned. Soon, Nicoli attempts to snipe Popeye in Brooklyn but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated subway train . Popeye shouts to a policeman on the train to catch Nicoli and then commandeers a passing car. He gives chase, crashing into several vehicles on the way. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli shoots the policeman who tries to intervene, and hijacks the train at gunpoint, forcing the motorman to drive through the next station and shooting the conductor. The motorman suffers a heart attack, and the train is about to collide with another when the emergency brake engages, hurling Nicoli to the floor. Popeye arrives and sees Nicoli descending from the platform. Nicoli sees Popeye and turns to run, but Popeye shoots him dead. After a long stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, mechanics tear the car apart in a search for drugs, initially coming up empty-handed. Cloudy discovers that the car's weight was recorded at 120 pounds over its standard, implying that the contraband must still be in the car – packages of heroin are finally discovered beneath the rocker panels. The police re-hide the contraband and reassemble the car, returning it to Devereaux who delivers it to Charnier. Charnier drives to an old factory on Wards Island , where Boca's brother Lou works, to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panel covers removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality . Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money inside the rocker panels of another car purchased at a junk car auction, which he plans to take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but a large contingent of police led by Popeye blocks their path. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout. Most of the other criminals surrender. Charnier escapes into a nearby abandoned bakery with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire too late to heed a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, he tells Cloudy he will get Charnier. He reloads his gun and runs into another room. A single gunshot is heard. Title cards describe various characters' fates: Weinstock was indicted, but his case was dismissed for \"lack of proper evidence\"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; Charnier was never caught and is believed to be back in France.

Pi tells the writer the following story: Pi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after Piscine Molitor , a famous French swimming pool. In secondary school in Pondicherry , he adopts the Greek letter \" Pi \" as his nickname to avoid bullying, because his first name Piscine sounds like ‘pissing’. He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam , and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". Pi's mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Their family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After he gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness it killing a goat. When Pi is 16, his father announces that due to \" The Emergency \", they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He struggles to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed plains zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench , drowning his family. After the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a Bornean orangutan . A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin , forcing Pi to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker suddenly emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating to cover. Pi fashions a small raft which he tethers to the lifeboat to be safe from Richard Parker. His moral code is against killing, but he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and swims toward Pi, he considers letting him drown but ultimately helps him into the boat. One night, a humpback whale destroys the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat and realizes that caring for the tiger is helping to keep himself alive. Weeks later, they encounter a floating island . It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of meerkats , enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat, drink and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower. Pi and Richard Parker leave the island, reaching Mexico after over 200 days at sea. Pi is heartbroken that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. While he recovers in a hospital, insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened, specifically concerning why the ship sank. So Pi retells the story, in which the animals are replaced by humans: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable Buddhist sailor for the zebra, the ship's brutish cook for the hyena, and Pi himself for Richard Parker. The cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He then kills Pi's mother, after which Pi kills him and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story but leave without questioning him further. When the writer recognizes the animal story may be an allegory for the human story, Pi says that it does not matter which story is true because his family died either way, and neither story provides the explanation the insurance company wanted. He asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, the writer reads that Pi survived his adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger\".",

    "obfuscated_plot": "A writer meets a young man in a coastal city, who tells him a remarkable story of survival. The protagonist is named after a famous swimming location, and in school adopts a mathematical symbol as a nickname to avoid bullying. Raised in a religious household, he explores multiple faith traditions, supported by his mother but challenged by his rationalist father. His family owns a zoo, and he develops a complex relationship with a dangerous wild animal.\n\nWhen he is 16, due to political unrest, his family decides to relocate to another continent, transporting their zoo animals by sea. During a violent storm, the ship sinks, drowning his entire family. He finds himself on a small lifeboat with several wild animals - a wounded plains animal, a primate, and a predatory scavenger. The wild predator kills the other animals, and a large tiger emerges, becoming his unexpected companion.\n\nSurviving at sea, he creates a small secondary raft for safety and begins fishing to sustain himself and the tiger. Despite his moral reservations about violence, he learns to coexist with the dangerous animal. They encounter a mysterious floating island with lush vegetation and small mammals, which transforms into a threatening environment at night, forcing them to flee.\n\nAfter over 200 days at sea, they reach land. The tiger disappears into the wilderness without acknowledging him. When insurance investigators interview him, he offers two versions of his survival story: one involving animals, another involving human survivors. He suggests that the truth is less important than the survival itself, and leaves the listener to choose which narrative they prefer."

The opposing Mexican forces, led by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna are numerically stronger as well as better-armed and trained. Nevertheless, the Texans have spirit and morale remains generally high. Lieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo , a former mission in San Antonio . Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans. Santa Anna's armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approaches the Alamo, and as they list the terms of surrender, Travis fires a cannon, signalling his refusal to surrender. In a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage a super-sized cannon used by the Mexicans. They maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel James Fannin is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help, knowing this will perhaps spare Smitty's life. The Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans' own losses are not insignificant, and Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when a messenger informs Travis that Fannin's reinforcements have been ambushed and slaughtered by the Mexicans . Travis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving. Crockett, Bowie and their men prepare to leave, but an inspired tribute by Travis convinces them to stay and fight to the end. The noncombatants, including most of the women and children, leave the Alamo. On the thirteenth day of the siege, Santa Anna's artillery bombards the Alamo, and the entire Mexican army sweeps forward, attacking on all sides. The defenders kill numerous Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming and the fortress' walls are breached. Travis tries to rally the men, but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort, but the Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the defenders. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies.

Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis. Despite their personal conflicts, all three learn to subordinate their differences, and in the end, bind themselves together in an act of bravery to defend the fort against inevitable defeat.",

    "plot": "In Chicago , vascular surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble is arrested for the murder of his wife, Helen. Despite his insisting he caught a man with a prosthetic arm in the act, the lack of forced entry into the house, Helen's misinterpreted 911 call, and a substantial life insurance policy all serve as evidence against Kimble, resulting him being convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. En route to prison, Kimble's fellow prisoners stage an escape. In the chaos, the driver is shot dead and their bus crashes into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble risks his life to pull a wounded officer to safety before fleeing the resulting wreck. In response, relentless and uncompromising Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard and his staff arrive at the scene and launch a manhunt. Meanwhile, Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his injuries and disguises his appearance. The wounded officer is brought to the hospital and recognizes Kimble, who escapes with an ambulance. The marshals block Kimble's path, so he slips into a storm drain, pursued by Gerard. Kimble asserts his innocence, but Gerard responds that he does not care. Cornered at the end of a steep dam spillway , Kimble makes the dangerous jump into the waters below to escape. Driven to find his wife's killer, Kimble returns to Chicago and acquires some cash from his friend, Dr. Charles Nichols. Posing as a janitor, Kimble infiltrates the prosthetics department of Cook County Hospital to identify patients who required recent prosthetic adjustments. Afterwards, Kimble is asked to move a young patient on a gurney. Noticing he has been misdiagnosed, he changes the boy's file, saving his life. A doctor notices his interference and alerts security, forcing him to flee. Gerard investigates the incident and, after deducing Kimble is searching for his \"one-armed man\", also compiles a list of suspects. Gerard and Kimble encounter each other at Chicago City Hall , while approaching the same suspect, but Gerard loses Kimble in the St. Patrick's Day parade crowds. Later, Kimble breaks into the home of another suspect, Fredrick Sykes. Recognizing Sykes as his wife's killer, he discovers evidence linking Sykes to his former colleague, Dr. Alec Lentz, and Devlin-MacGregor, a multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical company developing a drug called Provasic. Kimble had reviewed Provasic and discovered it causes liver damage, which should have prevented the drug being approved for sale. He calls Gerard from Sykes's home to lead him there. Suspicious at what he finds, Gerard puts Sykes under surveillance, but he sneaks away. Kimble realizes that the Provasic-afflicted liver samples he sent to Lentz were tampered with, to hide the side effects. They were then approved in Lentz's name, on the same day that he died under suspicious circumstances. Kimble deduces that Nichols, Lentz's boss, was responsible for both. Aboard a train to the medical conference in the hotel where Nichols will unveil Provasic, Kimble is attacked by Sykes, who ends up shooting an intervening police officer dead. Kimble subdues Sykes, then handcuffs him to the train. The police assume Kimble killed the officer and order him shot on sight. At the conference, Kimble publicly confronts Nichols for killing Lentz and concealing Provasic's side effects for profit and a directorship at Devlin-MacGregor. The men fight through the hotel, across the roof, and into the laundry room, pursued by Gerard. Kimble accuses Nichols of sending Sykes to kill him for opposing Provasic, inadvertently resulting in Helen's murder when she came home alone after Kimble was unexpectedly called in for surgery. Gerard calls out to Kimble, asserting his belief in his innocence after finding evidence of Nichols's guilt. Nichols knocks out Gerard's colleague, takes his gun, and readies to shoot Gerard, but Kimble saves him by knocking Nichols out with a pipe. Kimble surrenders, and Sykes and Nichols are arrested. While reporters query the police over failings in the case, Kimble is escorted to Gerard's car, where he reminds him of his earlier claim that he did not care. Gerard wryly asks him to keep it a secret that he does as they are driven away.",

As punishment, Sheriff \"Little Bill\" Daggett orders Mike and his associate who was with him at the brothel, Davey Bunting, to turn over several of their ponies to Delilah's employer, Skinny DuBois, for his loss of revenue. Outraged, the prostitutes offer a $1,000 bounty for the cowboys' deaths. In Hodgeman County , Kansas , a boastful young man visits Will Munny's hog farm. He calls himself the \" Schofield Kid\" and claims to be an experienced bounty hunter looking for help pursuing the cowboys. Formerly a notorious outlaw and murderer, Will is now a repentant widower raising two children. After initially refusing to help, Will realizes that his farm is failing and his children's future is in jeopardy. He recruits his friend Ned Logan, another retired outlaw, and they catch up with the Kid, whom they discover is severely near-sighted . Back in Big Whiskey, British-born gunfighter \"English\" Bob, an old acquaintance and rival of Little Bill's, arrives in town with his biographer W. W. Beauchamp, seeking the bounty. Enforcing the town's antigun law, Little Bill, with his deputies, disarms Bob and beats him savagely to discourage others from attempting to claim the bounty. Bob, humiliated, is banished from town the next morning, but Beauchamp stays out of a fascination with the sheriff, who debunks many of the romantic notions Beauchamp has about the Wild West . Little Bill explains to Beauchamp that the best attribute for a gunslinger is to be cool-headed under fire rather than to have the quickest draw, and to always kill the best shooter first. Will, Ned, and the Kid arrive in town during a rainstorm and enter Skinny's saloon. While Ned and the Kid meet with the prostitutes upstairs, Little Bill confronts a feverish Will. Not realizing Will's identity, but correctly guessing that he wants the bounty, Bill confiscates his weapon and beats him. Ned and the Kid escape through a back window and take Will to an unoccupied barn outside of town, where they and the prostitutes nurse him back to health. A few days later, the trio ambush Davey. After missing Davey and shooting his horse, Ned falters and Will shoots Davey instead. Ned decides to quit and return to Kansas. Ned is later captured and flogged to death by Little Bill to learn the whereabouts of Will and the Kid. Will takes the Kid with him to the cowboys' ranch, directing him to ambush Quick Mike in the outhouse and shoot him. After they escape, a distraught Kid drunkenly confesses he had never killed anyone before. A prostitute arrives with the reward and tells them about Ned's fate. Shocked by the news, Will begins drinking and demands the Kid's revolver. The Kid hands it over, saying that he no longer wants to be a killer, and Will sends him back to Kansas to distribute the reward. That night, Will finds Ned's corpse displayed in a coffin outside Skinny's saloon. Inside, Little Bill and his deputies are organizing a posse . Will walks in alone and kills Skinny for displaying Ned's corpse, then aims at Little Bill, but the shotgun misfires. In the ensuing gunfight, Will shoots Little Bill and several other members of the posse with the revolver. He then orders the rest of the men out, including Beauchamp. After a failed attempt to shoot Will, Little Bill bemoans his fate and curses Will, who then shoots him dead, before leaving out of town. A closing title card states that Will's mother-in-law found his farm abandoned years later, Will having possibly moved to San Francisco with the children. She remained at a loss to understand why her daughter married such a notorious outlaw and murderer.",

Mr. Andrews sequesters Ellie on his Florida yacht while his lawyers arrange an annulment . However, Ellie breaks out and swims to shore, where she boards a Greyhound bus bound for New York City to reunite with Westley. Mr. Andrews makes headlines by putting out a $10,000 reward (equivalent to $235,050 in 2024) for her safe return. On the bus, Ellie meets Peter Warne, a newly unemployed newspaper reporter. Peter is annoyed by Ellie, who expects special treatment and lacks practical life skills. However, he is drawn to Ellie's strong personality and helps her after a thief steals most of her money. During a scheduled stop in Jacksonville , Ellie misses the bus, having assumed that the driver would wait for her. Peter reads the headlines about Ellie's escape and stays behind to accompany her. He gives her a choice: if she gives him an exclusive on her story, he will help her get back to New York. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees. Because there are no more buses that day, Peter and Ellie rent a motel room together. Peter strings up a makeshift room divider between their respective beds, which he jokingly calls the \" walls of Jericho \". In the morning, Mr. Andrews' private detectives question Peter and Ellie.

In reality, Peter just wants Mr. Andrews to reimburse him for his expenses from the trip, which come out to $39.60. Mr. Andrews is impressed by Peter's honesty and asks him whether he loves Ellie; after dodging the question several times, Peter admits that he loves her.

The book, written in 1985, recounts a visit the author made in 1968 to the eponymous hotel, which was once a famous resort but had by then fallen on hard times. During his stay, he struck up a friendship with the hotel's proprietor, Zero Moustafa, who told him his rags to riches story over dinner. In 1932, Zero, an orphan who has come to Zubrowka to escape his war-torn homeland, is hired as a lobby boy by Monsieur Gustave H., the concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel. Gustave is a ladykiller who romances old, wealthy residents at the hotel, including dowager Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (known as Madame D.), with whom he has had a nearly two-decade affair. Madame D. mysteriously dies a month after her last visit, so Gustave and Zero visit her estate to pay their respects. There, her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, announces that she has bequeathed the famous Renaissance painting Boy with Apple to Gustave (much to the chagrin of her son, Dmitri). Gustave and Zero abscond with the painting, hiding it in a safe in the Grand Budapest. Madame D.'s butler, Serge, makes a deposition implicating Gustave in her death. Gustave is arrested on suspicion of murder, while Serge goes into hiding. During his imprisonment, Gustave earns the trust of a gang of inmates by providing them with pastries from Mendl's, a well-known bakery. The inmates let him in on their escape plan. Gustave has Zero and his fiancée, Agatha (who works at Mendl's), hide hammers, chisels, and sawblades inside the next shipment of pastries. Using these tools, the inmates break free. Meanwhile, Dmitri sends his hitman, J. G. Jopling, to kill Kovacs, whom he suspects of disloyalty, as well as Serge's sister, who refuses to give up her brother's whereabouts. After Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges known as the Society of the Crossed Keys. The society locates Serge and facilitates a meeting between him, Gustave, and Zero. Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling off a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape, pursued by Inspector Henckels of the Zubrowkan police. Gustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it swarming with fascist troops, who have made it their headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save her, but Dmitri shoots at them, triggering an all-out firefight. Henckels eventually puts a stop to the chaos. On the back of the painting, the group finds Madame D.'s second will. The will reveals that Madame D. was the owner of the Grand Budapest and names Gustave as her sole beneficiary. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri (now the prime suspect) flees the country. As a result of the bequest, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. Zero takes over as concierge and marries Agatha in a ceremony officiated by Gustave. However, while the three are traveling by train, Gustave gets into a quarrel with a group of thuggish soldiers and is killed. His own will bequeaths the hotel and his fortune to Zero.

However, Bernie insists on the down-on-his-luck Frank, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife Georgie. Frank is actually a demanding alcoholic who is completely dependent on his wife. Initially Frank leads Bernie to believe that Georgie is the reason for the decline in his career, resulting in Bernie mistakenly blaming her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including Frank's requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract, first behind her back and eventually to her face. The real reason Frank's career has faltered is his insecurity. When their five-year-old son Johnny was hit by a car and died while in Frank's care, he was devastated. Bernie also believed Georgie to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually Frank who is both. Humiliated when he learns the truth, Bernie realizes that behind his hatred of Georgie was a strong attraction to her, and he kisses her.

    "obfuscated_plot": "In a theatre, auditions are being held for a new musical production. A director watches a performance by a fading star and suggests that he be cast in the leading role. This is met with strong opposition from the show's producer. However, the director insists on the down-on-his-luck performer, who is living in a modest apartment with his wife. The performer is actually a demanding alcoholic who is completely dependent on his wife. Initially, he leads the director to believe that his wife is the reason for the decline in his career, resulting in the director mistakenly blaming her for everything that happens during rehearsals, including the performer's requests for a dresser and a run-of-the-show contract, first behind her back and eventually to her face. The real reason the performer's career has faltered is his insecurity. When their young son was hit by a car and died while in the performer's care, he was devastated. The director also believed the wife to be suicidal and a drunk, when it is actually the performer who is both. Humiliated when he learns the truth, the director realizes that behind his hatred of the wife was a strong attraction to her, and he kisses her. She tells him that it does not mean that anything has changed. The performer's performance is a success on opening night. Afterward, he demands respect from the producer. Previously, the wife had said that if only the performer could stand on his own two feet, she could get away from him. At a party to celebrate the play's opening, the director believes the wife will be free to leave the performer and tells her that he loves her. Later, the performer tells them he has noticed their longing looks, and all three talk. Shortly after, the performer leaves the party. The wife says goodbye to the director, and he tells her he appreciates a woman who is loyal. She kisses him lightly and goes to catch up with the performer."

    "plot": "The son of a highly respected music professor, Florenz \"Flo\" Ziegfeld Jr. yearns to make his mark in show business. He begins by promoting Eugen Sandow , the \"world's strongest man\", at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair , overcoming the competition of rival Jack Billings and his popular attraction, belly dancer Little Egypt , with savvy marketing (allowing women to feel Sandow's muscles). Ziegfeld returns to his father and young Mary Lou at the Chicago Musical College , and departs to San Francisco, where he and Sandow are deemed frauds for putting on a show in which Sandow faces a lion who falls asleep as soon as it is let out of the cage. Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is laughing at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud. Flo discovers that Billings is on his way to sign a contract with beautiful French star Anna Held . Despite losing all his money gambling at Monte Carlo, Flo charms Anna into signing with him instead, pretending that he doesn't know Billings. Anna twice almost sends him away for his rudeness and for being broke, before revealing that she appreciates his honesty. Ziegfeld promises to give her \"more publicity than she ever dreams of\" and to feature her alongside America's most prominent theatrical performers. At first, Anna's performance at the Herald Square Theatre is not a success. However, Flo manages to generate publicity by sending 20 gallons of milk to Anna every day for a fictitious milk bath beauty treatment, then refusing to pay the bill. The newspaper stories soon bring the curious to pack his theater, and Ziegfeld introduces eight new performers to back her. Audience members comment on how the milk must make her skin beautiful and the show is a major success. Flo sends Anna flowers and jewelry and a note saying \"you were magnificent my wife\", and she agrees to marry him, flaunting her new diamonds to her fellow performers. However, one success is not enough for the showman. He has an idea for an entirely new kind of show featuring a bevy of blondes and brunettes, one that will \"glorify\" the American girl. The new show, the Ziegfeld Follies , an opulent production filled with beautiful women and highly extravagant costumes and sets, is a smash hit, and is followed by more versions of the Follies. Ziegfeld tries to make a star out of Audrey Dane, who is plagued with alcoholism, and he lures Fanny Brice from vaudeville , showering both with lavish gifts. He gives stagehand Ray Bolger his break as well. Mary Lou, now a young woman, visits Ziegfeld, who doesn't recognize her initially, and hires her as a dancer. The new production upsets Anna, who realizes that Flo's world does not revolve around just her, and she becomes envious of the attention he pays to Audrey. She divorces him after walking in on Flo and a drunk Audrey at the wrong moment. Audrey walks out on Flo and the show after an angry confrontation. Broke, Flo borrows money from Billings for a third time for the new show. Flo meets the red-headed Broadway star Billie Burke and soon marries her. When she hears the news, a heartbroken Anna telephones Flo and pretends to be glad for him. Flo and Billie eventually have a daughter named Patricia . Flo's new shows are a success, but after a while, the public's taste changes, and people begin to wonder if the times have not passed him by. After a string of negative reviews in the press, Flo overhears three men in a barber's shop saying that he'll \"never produce another hit\". Stung, he vows to have four hits on Broadway at the same time. He achieves his goal, with the hits Show Boat (1927), Rio Rita (1927), Whoopee! (1928), and The Three Musketeers , and invests over $1 million (US$18,312,016 in 2024 dollars [ 3 ] ) of his earnings in the stock market. However, the stock market crash of 1929 bankrupts him, forcing Billie to return to the stage. Shaken by the reversal of his financial fortunes and the growing popularity of movies over live stage shows, he becomes seriously ill. Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of The Ziegfeld Follies . But the reality is that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this. In the final scene in his apartment overlooking the Ziegfeld Theatre , in a half-delirium, he recalls scenes from several of his hits, exclaiming, \"I've got to have more steps, higher, higher\", before dying in his chair.",

Ki-woo recommends \"Jessica,\" actually Ki-jung, as an art therapist for the Parks' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a \"ghost\" in their kitchen. Ki-jung then frames Yoon, the Parks' chauffeur, by making it appear as though he had a sexual encounter in the car, leading to Ki-taek being hired as his replacement.

She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the house's architect and previous owner, who had kept its existence secret from the Parks. There, Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been hiding from loan sharks and is revealed to be the \"ghost\" Da-song saw when he was trying to leave the bunker to steal food. Moon-gwang begs Chung-sook to allow Geun-sae to continue living there in exchange for regular payments, but the three other Kims, who are eavesdropping, accidentally reveal their true identities. Moon-gwang films them and threatens to expose their deception to the Parks.

Waters later arrives at a crime scene, where the body of an unnamed dead child has been discovered. The film then backtracks 48 hours to trace the preceding chain of events. Anthony and Peter, two young black men, carjack district attorney Rick Cabot and his wife Jean. As the men drive away in the SUV , Peter puts a figurine of St. Christopher , the patron saint of travelers, on the dashboard. They pass by Waters and Ria, who are investigating a homicide in a San Fernando Valley parking lot. The pair learn that a white undercover cop, Detective Conklin, shot a black undercover cop, Detective Lewis, with neither knowing the other was a policeman. At home, Cabot rails that the carjacking incident could cost him re-election, because no matter whom he sides with, he will lose either the black vote or the law and order vote. Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz overhears Jean, who suspects that Daniel is a gangster, demanding that the locks be changed again. While searching for the Cabots' stolen vehicle, Sergeant John Ryan pulls over an SUV driven by a wealthy Black couple, TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife, Christine. Though Ryan knows the vehicle is not the one he is searching for, he accosts the couple on his claim he saw Christine performing fellatio on Cameron while he was driving. During the traffic stop, Ryan performs a body search on Christine and molests her in front of Cameron. Ryan's younger partner, Officer Tom Hansen, looks on in horror but does not intervene. Hansen goes to his superior Lieutenant Dixon to report Ryan's conduct and requests a transfer. Dixon, a black man, tells Hansen that a racism complaint would hurt his own career and allows the transfer on the condition that Ryan's conduct not be mentioned. Ryan is shown living with his ill father, who cannot get health insurance. On the phone, Ryan takes out his frustrations on the black HMO administrator he speaks with. When the insurance adjuster does not respond quickly enough, Ryan insults her competency by saying that more qualified White men did not get her job because of affirmative action . In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a man of Asian descent while passing a parked van. They take the injured man and leave him in front of a hospital. Meanwhile, Waters, who is in a relationship with Ria, gets into an argument with her when he makes a casual remark about Mexico being her country of origin. Ria angrily reminds him that her father is actually from Puerto Rico and her mother is from El Salvador . Waters later visits his mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother. Ryan later comes across a car crash and an overturned vehicle. In his attempt to rescue the passenger, Ryan sees it is Christine, who recognizes the officer from their earlier incident and frantically resists his assistance. Ryan manages to pull her out of the car just before it is engulfed by a fireball. As Christine is being helped by paramedics, she stares at Ryan. Waters is summoned to a meeting with DA worker Flanagan, who tells Waters that Internal Affairs wants Conklin imprisoned. Waters has evidence that Lewis was possibly involved in a drug deal, but Flanagan promises Waters a job as Cabot's chief investigator, as well as the clearing of his brother's criminal record, in exchange for his cooperation. At a press conference, Waters reluctantly confirms the homicide was racially motivated. Anthony and Peter carjack another Navigator , which happens to belong to Cameron. Cameron fights back and Peter flees the scene before a police car approaches. Cameron and Anthony drive away and a police chase ensues, with Hansen as one of the pursuing officers. When police catch the SUV, Hansen recognizes Cameron, and out of remorse for the earlier traffic stop, he vouches for Cameron to be let off with a warning. Anthony, who was hiding during the exchange, is dropped off at a bus stop by Cameron. Later that night as Hansen is off the clock, he picks up a hitchhiking Peter. During the drive, Peter reaches into his pocket and Hansen, thinking he is reaching for a gun, shoots him. Peter collapses dead, revealing he was only reaching for his Saint Christopher statuette. Hansen hides the body in some bushes and burns his car. Waters and Ria later arrive at the scene, and it is revealed that the dead body is Waters's brother Peter. Waters's mother disowns him over Peter's death. Anthony comes across the white van from earlier with its keys still in the ignition. He steals the van and takes it to a chop shop , where it is discovered there are Cambodian immigrants chained in the back. The van had belonged to Kim Lee and her husband (the man Anthony and Peter accidentally hit), meaning they were involved in human trafficking . The chop shop owner offers Anthony $500 per immigrant, but Anthony refuses. After driving the Cambodians to Chinatown and freeing them, he passes by a fender-bender.

Through interactions with locals, including Juan, a café owner, and a traveling priest, Homer learns of the nuns' harrowing escape from behind the Iron Curtain and their impoverished existence. Despite their inability to pay, he begrudgingly prolongs his stay, lured by the challenge of building a chapel for the nearby Mexican American community. Homer's initial reluctance gives way to ambition when he confesses his unrealized dream of becoming an architect.

The next morning, after Connie leaves for work, Dingle meets Sergeant Joe Carter, who is interested in a room to stay for a week while waiting to be shipped overseas. Recognizing Joe as a suitable young man for Connie, Dingle rents him half of his half. When Connie discovers the new arrangement, she angrily orders both men to leave, but is forced to relent because she has already spent the pair's rent. Joe and Connie soon develop a mutual attraction, though she is engaged to pompous bureaucrat Charles J. Pendergast. Connie's mother married for love, not security, and Connie is determined not to repeat that mistake. Dingle meets Pendergast by chance at a business luncheon the following day and decides that Joe would be a better match for Connie. One day, Dingle reads aloud to Joe from Connie's diary, including her thoughts about Joe. Dingle is caught by Connie, who demands they both leave the next day. Dingle takes full blame for the incident, and retreats to his now-available hotel room. Joe gives Connie a traveling bag as an apology gift, and she allows him to stay until he departs for Africa in two days. Joe asks Connie out to dinner that night; she is initially reluctant but decides she will accept his invitation if Pendergast does not call her by 8:00. At 8:00, Joe and Connie prepare to leave, but her nosy teenage neighbor seeks her advice and delays her until Pendergast arrives downstairs. As Connie and Pendergast leave together, Joe spies on the couple from his window with binoculars. When the neighbor asks what he is doing, Joe flippantly tells him he is a Japanese spy. Dingle calls Joe to meet him for dinner at a restaurant, where they run into Connie and Pendergast. Playing Cupid , Dingle invites Pendergast to his suite to discuss the housing shortage, so that Joe and Connie can be alone together. Later, Joe walks Connie home. The two share their romantic pasts and end up kissing on the front steps. Inside, a sleepless Joe confesses through his bedroom wall that he loves her. She tells him she feels the same way, but refuses to marry him, as they will soon be forced apart when he leaves for Africa. Joe and Connie are interrupted by the arrival of two brusque FBI agents, who have been tipped off that Joe is a Japanese spy. Joe and Connie are taken to FBI headquarters. They assert that Dingle can vouch for Joe's identity and innocence. Dingle arrives, bringing Pendergast. During questioning, Pendergast is shocked to learn that Joe and Connie share the same address. When they ask Dingle to tell Pendergast that their living arrangement is purely innocent, he denies knowing them. Outside the station, Dingle says he lied to protect his reputation. Taking a taxi home, they all discuss what to do to avoid a scandal. Connie is angry that Pendergast only cares about his career and returns his ring. When another passenger in the shared cab turns out to be a reporter, Pendergast runs after him to try to stop him from writing about his fiancée cohabiting with Joe. Dingle assures Connie that if she marries Joe, the crisis will be averted, and they can file for a quick annulment afterwards. With 26 hours until Joe leaves for Africa, they follow his advice and fly to South Carolina to wed, where a license can be more quickly obtained than in D.C. Returning home, Connie allows Joe to spend his final night in her apartment. As Dingle had foreseen, Connie's attraction to Joe may yet overcome her misgivings; this is facilitated by Dingle having conscripted a group of men living downstairs to remove the wall between their two bedrooms.

    "plot": "In 1890 Paris , crowds gather at the Moulin Rouge as artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec finishes a bottle of cognac while sketching the dancers. Regular patrons arrive: singer Jane Avril teases Henri, dancers La Goulue and Aicha argue, and owner Maurice Joyant offers Henri free drinks for a promotional poster. After closing, Henri reveals his 4-foot-6-inch (137 cm) stature. A flashback shows that, as a child, he injured his legs in a fall, which never healed due to a genetic disorder from his parents being first cousins . On his way home to Montmartre , Henri helps streetwalker Marie Charlet escape the police. Impressed by her lack of judgment about his disability, Henri allows her to stay with him. He soon realizes poverty has made her both harsh and free from societal hypocrisy. After a night out, she insults a portrait he painted of her, and he throws her out, sinking into alcoholism. His landlady Madame Louet contacts his mother Countess Adele, who urges him to find Marie to lift his spirits. Henri finds her drunk in a café, where she admits she stayed with him only to save money for her boyfriend, who has now left her. Depressed, Henri returns home and contemplates suicide but finds sudden inspiration to complete the Moulin Rouge poster. Surviving his crisis, he arranges for Marie to receive money for a new life. Henri delivers the poster to Maurice, who accepts it despite its unconventional style. His success grows, but one of his risqué portraits leads his father to denounce his work. Henri continues depicting Parisian nightlife, gaining fame but few friends. One day, he meets a young woman, Myriamme Hyam, on the Pont Alexandre III , seemingly about to jump into the Seine. She assures him she is not suicidal and throws a key into the river. Later, while shopping with Jane, Henri recognizes Myriamme modeling gowns. A friend of Jane's, she lives independently. Henri is surprised when Myriamme reveals she bought his portrait of Marie at a flea market. The key Myriamme discarded belonged to a suitor, Marcel de la Voisier, who wanted her as a lover but refused to marry her. Though cynical about love, Henri begins to fall in love with her. One evening, Henri and Myriamme encounter La Goulue, now a washed-up, drunken figure, and Henri realizes the Moulin Rouge has become respectable. Myriamme informs Henri that Marcel has proposed. Henri bitterly congratulates her. When she asks if he loves her, Henri lies and says he does not, believing she is toying with his feelings. The next day, Henri receives a letter from Myriamme, confessing her love and that his bitterness has ruined their chance at happiness. He rushes to her apartment, but she has already left. A year later, Henri, now an alcoholic, is found drunk in a dive bar, still obsessed with Myriamme's letter. Taken home, he suffers from delirium tremens and hallucinates cockroaches. While trying to fend them off, he falls down the stairs. Taken to his family's chateau, his condition worsens. On his deathbed, Henri's father informs him he will be the first living artist to be exhibited in the Louvre and begs for forgiveness. In his final moments, Henri envisions figures from his Moulin Rouge paintings dancing around his room.",

    "plot": "In 1972, Ron Stallworth is hired as the first black officer in the Colorado Springs Police Department . Assigned to work in the records room, he tires of being bullied and applies to be an undercover officer. He is assigned to infiltrate a local rally where national civil rights leader Kwame Ture (a.k.a. Stokely Carmichael) is speaking. At the rally, Stallworth meets Patrice Dumas, president of the Black Student Union at Colorado College . While taking Ture to his hotel, Patrice is stopped by patrolman Andy Landers, a racist officer in Stallworth's precinct, who threatens Ture and gropes Patrice. Following the rally, Stallworth is reassigned to the intelligence division. After reading about a local division of the Ku Klux Klan in the newspaper, he calls posing as a white man. He speaks with Walter Breachway, the president of the Colorado Springs chapter, but soon realizes that not only did he use his real name, but he must also meet the Klan members. Stallworth recruits his Jewish coworker, Flip Zimmerman, to impersonate him and meet the KKK members while he continues posing as white on the phone. Under Stallworth's identity, Zimmerman meets Breachway, the slightly more reckless and unstable Felix Kendrickson (and later his wife Connie), and Ivanhoe, who cryptically refers to an upcoming terrorist attack. Calling Ku Klux Klan headquarters in Louisiana to expedite his membership, Stallworth begins regular phone conversations with Grand Wizard David Duke . Kendrickson suspects Zimmerman of being Jewish and tries to force him to take a polygraph test at gunpoint, but Stallworth, overhearing everything on the wire Zimmerman is wearing, breaks the Kendricksons' kitchen window as a distraction. Stallworth begins dating Patrice without telling her that he is a police officer. After passing information to the Army CID about active-duty members, he learns from an FBI agent that two members are personnel stationed at NORAD , a critical, high-security defense facility. Duke visits Colorado Springs for Stallworth's induction into the Klan. Over the real Stallworth's protests, the detective is assigned to a protection detail for Duke. Once Zimmerman, masquerading as Stallworth, is initiated, Connie Kendrickson leaves the ceremony to place an explosive device at a local civil rights rally. The real Stallworth realizes her intentions and alerts local police officers. When Connie notices a heavy police presence at the rally, she puts Felix's backup plan into action and plants the device at Dumas's house, leaving it under her car when it will not fit into the mailbox. Stallworth tackles her as she tries to flee, but uniformed officers detain and beat him despite his protests that he is working undercover. The bombmaker, Walker, had recognized Zimmerman from a prior arrest and informed Felix at the Klan reception.  He, Felix, and Ivanhoe drive to Dumas's house and park next to her car without realizing that the device is hidden underneath. When they detonate it, the explosion kills all three. Zimmerman arrives, frees Stallworth, and arrests Connie. While Stallworth is celebrating the closed case that night with Patrice, Landers arrives and drunkenly harasses the two, remorselessly admitting to his assault on Patrice. Stallworth reveals he is wearing a wire, and Police Chief Bridges arrives and arrests Landers for police brutality . Bridges congratulates the team for their success but orders them to end their investigation and destroy the records. Stallworth receives a call from Duke, and he insultingly tells Duke he is black before hanging up. Later while Dumas and Stallworth discuss their future, they are interrupted by a knock on the door. Through the window in the hallway, they see a flaming cross on a hillside surrounded by KKK members. The film cuts to footage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally , the hit and run attack that killed and injured protesters, part of a speech by David Duke, and comments by President Donald Trump . It ends with a dedication to Heather Heyer (who was killed in the attack) and lastly, shows an upside-down American flag fading to a black-and-white American flag, before fading to black.",

In 1959 they arrive in a quiet French village, overseen by mayor the Comte de Reynaud, at the start of Lent . Vianne opens a chocolate shop; despite not fitting in well with the townspeople, she begins to make headway with some of the villagers, getting them to come to her shop. Reynaud, who will not admit that his wife has left him, speaks out against Vianne for tempting the people during Lent. Armande, Vianne's elderly landlady, is one of her first allies. Armande's daughter Caroline will not let her see her grandson Luc, as she is a \"bad influence\". Vianne arranges for him and his grandmother to meet in the chocolaterie, where they bond. After finding out about their secret meetings, Caroline reveals her mother is diabetic, but she continues to eat the chocolate when visiting the shop. Vianne develops a friendship with Josephine, who is being physically abused by her husband Serge, the local café owner. Through their friendship, Josephine finds the courage to leave Serge after he beats her, moving in with Vianne and Anouk. As she works at the chocolate shop and learns the craft, her confidence slowly increases. Simultaneously, under Reynaud's instruction, Serge attempts to make amends for his abusiveness, eventually asking Josephine to come back to him, but she refuses. Later that night, a drunken Serge breaks into the shop, attacking both women, but Josephine knocks him out. As the rivalry between Vianne and Reynaud intensifies, a band of river Romani camp near the village. Although most of the town objects to their presence, Vianne embraces them and a mutual attraction develops between her and the leader, Roux. They hold a birthday party for Armande with villagers on Roux's boat. When Caroline sees Luc dancing with his grandmother, she begins to accept that Armande's influence in her son's life may be positive. Luc takes Armande home after the party, while Josephine and Anouk fall asleep on a boat, which Serge sets fire to, while Roux and Vianne make love on a barge in the river. No one is hurt in the fire, but Vianne is shaken. Armande later dies in her home and is discovered by Luc. This devastates both Luc and his mother. Meanwhile Roux packs up and leaves with his group. Reynaud initially believes the fire was divine intervention until Serge confesses to starting it, saying he thought it was what Reynaud wanted. Horrified, Reynaud orders him to leave the village and not to come back. With the return of the north wind, Vianne decides she cannot win against Reynaud, and decides to move on. Anouk, now attached to the town, refuses to go, and during a scuffle, the urn containing Vianne's mother's ashes breaks, scattering them over the floor. While recovering the ashes, Vianne sees a group of her friends who have come to help out in her shop, and understands the positive influence she has had on their lives. She decides to stay. Despite shifting sentiment in the town, Reynaud remains staunch in his abstinence from chocolate. On the Saturday evening before Easter, Reynaud sees Caroline, to whom he is attracted, leaving the chocolaterie and is devastated. He breaks into the shop that night, smashing the special window display for the Easter festival. After a morsel of chocolate falls on his lip, he devours much of the chocolate in the window before collapsing in tears and falling asleep. The next morning, Vianne wakes him and gives him a drink to help him recover. Reynaud apologizes for his behavior. Père Henri, the town's young priest, gives a sermon emphasizing the importance of humanity over divinity. The narrator, a grown-up Anouk, reveals that the sermon and festival are a success. Reynaud and Caroline start a relationship half a year later. Josephine takes over Serge's café, renaming it Café Armande. The north wind returns, but this time Vianne throws her mother's ashes out into the wind. Anouk concludes the story: Roux returns in the summer to be with Vianne and Anouk.",

As a newcomer, Layton receives a chilly welcome from his squad. Private First Class Holley returns to the company after recuperating from a wound. Instead of going on leave in Paris , the squad is trucked back to the front because of a surprise German breakthrough in the Ardennes . They stop that night in Bastogne and are put up for the night in the apartment of a young woman, Denise, to whom Holley is attracted. Jarvess later stands guard in the village, where he runs into some battle-weary soldiers making a \"strategic withdrawal\". The next morning, led by Platoon Sergeant Kinnie, the men are ordered to dig in on the outskirts of town. Just as they are nearly done, they are sent elsewhere and must dig in all over again. Holley, Layton, and Kippton man a roadblock that night. German soldiers disguised as Americans infiltrate their position and later blow-up a nearby bridge. In the morning, Roderigues, a Latino from Los Angeles , is delighted by the novelty of snow from a heavy winter storm, but \"Pop\" Stazak, awaiting a \"dependency discharge\" that will send him home, is unimpressed. Layton goes to see Hooper, only to find he had been killed, and no one in his company had even known his name. Kinnie informs the squad about the infiltration and dispatches a patrol comprising Holley, Roderigues, and Jarvess. Just before they start out, the platoon is shelled by German artillery, causing Bettis to panic and desert. Holley's patrol briefly skirmishes with the infiltrators. Roderigues is wounded by machine-gun fire from an enemy tank . Holley conceals him under a disabled jeep half-buried in snow, promising to return for him. Unfortunately, by the time Holley can return, Roderigues has died. Sgt. Wolowicz, wounded by shrapnel, and a sick Cpl. Standiferd are sent to a field hospital . Later, Doc informs the 2nd Squad that the hospital has been captured. Holley is appointed the new squad leader and partnered with Layton, while Pop is paired with Hansan. Pop's discharge finally comes in, but they learn from Kipp they are surrounded , meaning he's stuck and unable to leave. Moved repeatedly, the 3rd Platoon is attacked at dawn. When it appears the platoon will be overrun, Hansan is wounded, Holley flees, and Layton follows Holley. Ashamed, Holley turns around and leads a flanking counterattack that stops the Germans, during which Abner Spudler is killed reaching for his boots, as he can't sleep with them on and fellow Soldier Garby, who ignored the order to check if their bolts was frozen, also is killed. After they get Hanson to an aid station , the squad runs into Bettis, who is doing K.P. duty. Holley finds Layton being entertained by Denise. Later, while on guard duty, they encounter some Germans who have come under a flag of truce to offer Brigadier General McAuliffe surrender terms; his famous reply - \"Nuts!\" - puzzles the Germans.

(The chaplain had previously served as clergy at a Hanukkah ceremony, and when he asks a Jewish soldier how he did he responds, \"Not bad for a beginner, sir.\") The chaplain gives a short speech on the importance of the fight against fascism. He then asks \"The 64 dollar question is: was this trip worth it?\" After giving an affirmative explanation, he says that people will forget, but they won't, and \"don't let anyone ever tell you that you were a sucker to fight against fascism.\" That night, the Luftwaffe bombs Bastogne. Denise dies, and Bettis, slowed by his fear of returning to the lines, is killed by a collapsing house. The \"walking wounded\", including Hansan and a mess sergeant he befriends, are recalled for a last-ditch defense of the town. As the platoon is down to its last few rounds of ammunition, the weather finally clears, allowing Allied fighter aircraft to attack the Germans and C-47 transports to drop supplies, enabling the 101st to hold.

    "plot": "The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative . The following is a linear summary of the plot. In 1940, during the Battle of France , Allied soldiers retreat to Dunkirk to be evacuated . One, a British soldier named Tommy, loses his squadmates and flees through the perimeter held by French troops to the beach, where thousands await evacuation. He helps another soldier, Gibson, bury a body. After a Luftwaffe dive-bomber attack, they attempt to board a hospital ship at the single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep- draft ships, by rushing a wounded man on a stretcher to the ship but are ordered off. They overhear Commander Bolton, Colonel Winnant and a Rear Admiral discuss the best way to get their army evacuated. The ship is sunk by a Luftwaffe attack; Tommy saves a Highlanders regiment soldier, Alex, from being crushed by the wreck. That night, the three board a destroyer , but it is hit by a U-boat torpedo before it can depart; Gibson saves Tommy and Alex as the ship sinks, and an officer makes them return to the beach. The Royal Navy requisitions civilian vessels in England to get to Dunkirk. In Weymouth , civilian sailor Dawson and his son Peter set out in his boat Moonstone , rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Their teenage hand George joins them on impulse. In the English Channel , they save the officer, now shell-shocked after surviving a U-boat sinking. Realising that Dawson is going for Dunkirk, the officer grows fearful and Peter locks him up. He escapes, urging they turn back, and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, he elbows George, who falls down a staircase and suffers a severe head injury. Three Royal Air Force Spitfires fly towards Dunkirk to provide cover for the evacuation, limited to one hour of operation by their fuel supply. They engage in a dogfight with a Messerschmitt Bf 109 . After shooting it down, one of the pilots, Farrier, has his fuel gauge smashed by another fighter. He and the second Spitfire pilot, Collins, determine that their leader has gone down and fly on with Collins radioing Farrier about their remaining fuel. The crew of the Moonstone witness the two RAF pilots protect a minesweeper from a bomber escorted by fighters: Collins's Spitfire is hit and he ditches . Although trapped in his canopy as the plane sinks, Collins is saved by Peter. Becoming increasingly desperate, Tommy, Alex and Gibson join Highlanders soldiers in a grounded trawler in the intertidal zone outside the perimeter, hoping the tide will float them home. After its Dutch sailor returns, Germans start shooting at the boat for target practice, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, attempting to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has been silent the entire time, of being a German spy despite Tommy's pleas. Gibson reveals he is French, having taken the identity of the buried soldier in hopes of being evacuated earlier. The tide finally lifts the trawler but at sea, the group has to abandon the sinking boat. Gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. Noticing another bomber, Farrier chooses to continue aiding the evacuation, despite knowing he will never make it home. Despite his attempts, the destroyer is bombed and sinks, as Moonstone manoeuvres to save men in the water. Amidst the chaos, George dies. Farrier shoots the bomber down; its crash ignites oil on the water, but Tommy and Alex are saved by Moonstone . Farrier reaches Dunkirk just as his fuel runs out. Gliding, he shoots down a dive-bomber approaching the mole, and is cheered on by the troops. Farrier lands his Spitfire on the beach beyond the perimeter, burns it and calmly awaits capture as German soldiers approach. Dawson has Moonstone evade aerial attack, using a technique taught by his deceased elder son, a pilot lost at the start of the war. With 300,000 men successfully evacuated, Bolton stays to oversee the French evacuation. The officer and Collins part ways with the Dawsons, as Peter arranges for the local paper to eulogise George, fulfilling George's desire to do something that would make the newspaper. Tommy and Alex board a train with others and are heralded by the public at Woking , as Tommy reads Churchill's address to Alex from a newspaper.",

    "plot": "In 1963, Stephen Hawking, a post-graduate astrophysics student at the University of Cambridge , begins a relationship with literature student Jane Wilde . Although Stephen is intelligent, both his friends and academics are concerned about his lack of a thesis topic. After attending a lecture by Roger Penrose on black holes with his supervisor, Prof. Dennis Sciama , Stephen speculates that these may have been part of the creation of the universe and so decides upon his thesis. However, soon Stephen's muscles begin to fail, causing him to have decreased coordination with his body. After a bad fall, he is diagnosed with early-onset progressive degenerative motor neurone disease (MND) that will eventually leave him unable to move, swallow, and even breathe. With no treatment options, he is given approximately two years to live. The doctor assures Stephen that his brain will not be affected, so his thoughts and intelligence will remain intact, but eventually, he will be unable to communicate them. Stephen develops severe depression, becoming reclusive and focusing on his work. Jane confesses she loves him and that she intends to stay even as his condition worsens. They marry and have their first son, Robert. Once his walking ability deteriorates, he begins using a wheelchair. Inspired by Penrose’s work on spacetime singularities at the centre of black holes, Stephen presents his doctoral thesis viva extrapolating that a black hole created the universe in a Big Bang and it will end in a Big Crunch . After the Hawkings have their daughter Lucy , Jane becomes frustrated having to focus on the children, as well as Stephen's slowly degenerating health while his fame increases, all at the expense of her academic work. Stephen tells her he will understand if she needs help. In the 1970s, Jane joins a church choir, where she meets and becomes close friends with Jonathan, a widower . She employs him as a piano teacher for Robert, and Jonathan befriends the entire family, helping Stephen with his illness, supporting Jane, and playing with the children. When Jane gives birth to another son, Timothy, Stephen's mother asks her if the baby is Jonathan's. This causes outrage and Jonathan is appalled, but when he and Jane are alone, they admit the depth of their feelings for one another. He distances himself from the family, but Stephen tells him that Jane needs him. As the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, Stephen goes on to develop a theory about the visibility of black holes that they emit radiation and becomes a world-renowned physicist. In the 1980s, while attending an opera performance in Bordeaux on holiday, Stephen falls ill and is rushed to a hospital. The doctor informs Jane that he has pneumonia and the tracheotomy he needs to survive will leave him mute. She agrees to the surgery. Stephen learns to use a spelling board and uses it to communicate with his new nurse, Elaine Mason. He receives a computer with a built-in voice synthesizer and uses it to write a book, A Brief History of Time , which becomes an international best-seller. In the late 1980s, Stephen tells Jane he has been invited to the United States to accept an award and will take Elaine with him. Jane faces the fact that the marriage has not been working, saying she \"did her best\", and they agree to divorce . While Stephen has fallen in love with Elaine, Jane and Jonathan reunite. Stephen goes to deliver a public lecture where he sees a student drop a pen. He imagines getting up to return it, almost crying at the reminder of how his disease has affected him. He then gives a speech telling audiences to pursue their ambitions despite the harsh reality of life: \"While there's life, there is hope.\" On being made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1989, Stephen invites Jane to go with him to meet Queen Elizabeth II , where they share a happy day together with their three children. An extended closing series of select moments from the film, shown in reverse, back to the moment Stephen first saw Jane – the reversal is reminiscent of Stephen's research methodology of reversing time to understand the beginning of the universe. An epilogue reveals that A Brief History of Time has sold over ten million copies worldwide. In the late 1990s, Stephen declined an offer of a knighthood and has no plans to retire. Jane earned her Doctor of Philosophy in Medieval Spanish Poetry and married Jonathan.  Both Stephen and Jane remain friends, sharing three grandchildren.",

    "plot": "In 1947, over the Muroc Army Air Field in California, a number of test pilots are killed while flying high-speed aircraft such as the rocket-powered Bell X-1 . After another pilot, Slick Goodlin , demands $150,000  (equivalent to $2,112,000 in 2024) to attempt to break the sound barrier , war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. Yeager becomes the first person to fly at supersonic speed, defeating the \"demon in the sky.\" Six years later, Muroc, now Edwards Air Force Base , still attracts the best test pilots. Yeager (now a major) and friendly rival Scott Crossfield repeatedly break each other's speed records. They often visit the Happy Bottom Riding Club run by Pancho Barnes , who classifies the pilots at Edwards as either \"prime\" (such as Yeager and Crossfield) that fly the best equipment or newer \"pudknockers\" who only dream about it. Gordon \"Gordo\" Cooper , Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom and Donald \"Deke\" Slayton , captains of the United States Air Force , are among the \"pudknockers\" who hope to also prove that they have \"the Right Stuff.\" The tests are no longer secret, as the military soon recognizes that it needs good publicity for funding. Cooper's wife, Trudy, and other wives are afraid of becoming widows but cannot change their husbands' ambitions and desire for success and fame. In 1957, the launch of the Soviet Sputnik satellite alarms the United States government . Politicians such as Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and military leaders demand that NASA help America defeat the Soviets in the new Space Race . The search for the first Americans in space excludes Yeager because he lacks a college degree. Grueling physical and mental tests select the Mercury Seven astronauts, including John Glenn of the United States Marine Corps , Alan Shepard , Walter Schirra and Scott Carpenter of the United States Navy , as well as Cooper, Grissom and Slayton; they immediately become national heroes. Although many early NASA rockets explode during launch, the ambitious astronauts all hope to be the first in space as part of Project Mercury . Although engineers see the men as passengers, the pilots insist for the Mercury spacecraft to have a window, a hatch with explosive bolts, and pitch-yaw-roll controls. However, the Soviet Union beats them into space on April 12, 1961, with the launch of Vostok 1 carrying Yuri Gagarin . The seven astronauts are determined to match and to surpass the Soviets. Shepard is the first American to reach space on the 15-minute sub-orbital flight of Mercury-Redstone 3 on May 5. After Grissom's similar flight of Mercury-Redstone 4 on July 21, the capsule's hatch blows open and quickly fills with water. Grissom escapes, but the spacecraft, overweight with seawater, sinks. Many criticize Grissom for possibly panicking and opening the hatch prematurely. Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth on Mercury-Atlas 6 on February 20, 1962; he survives a possibly loose heat shield and receives a ticker-tape parade . He, his colleagues, and their families become celebrities, including a gigantic celebration in the Sam Houston Coliseum to announce the opening of the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , despite the fear of Glenn's wife, Annie , of public speaking because of a stutter . Although test pilots at Edwards mock the Mercury program for sending \"spam in a can\" into space, they recognize that they are no longer the fastest men on Earth, and Yeager states that \"it takes a special kind of man to volunteer for a suicide mission, especially when it's on national TV.\" While testing the new Lockheed NF-104A , Yeager attempts to set a new altitude record at the edge of space but is nearly killed in a high-speed ejection when his engine fails. Though seriously burned after reaching the ground, Yeager gathers up his parachute and walks to the ambulance, which proves his worth. On May 15, 1963, Cooper has a successful launch on Mercury-Atlas 9 , which ends the Mercury program. As the last American to fly into space alone, he \"went higher, farther, and faster than any other American ... for a brief moment, Gordo Cooper became the greatest pilot anyone had ever seen.\"",

He is befriended by Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, a contraband smuggler serving a life sentence, who procures for him a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth . Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently raped by \"the Sisters\" gang, led by Bogs Diamond. In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton assigns Andy to the prison's decrepit library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, but in reality, to utilize Andy's financial expertise in managing the warden's and other prison staff's finances. Andy also starts writing weekly letters to the state legislature , requesting funding to improve the library. Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. After years of Andy's ceaseless letters, the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro ; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before he is punished with solitary confinement . After his release, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\". In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young inmate convicted of burglary. Andy helps Tommy pass his General Educational Development exam, and Tommy later reveals that his cellmate at another prison confessed to committing the murders for which Andy was convicted. When Andy informs Norton, the warden refuses to act. Although Andy promises to keep the money laundering a secret, Norton has Hadley kill Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt and sends Andy to solitary confinement. Norton then threatens to destroy the library, strip Andy of guard protection, and transfer him to harsher conditions if he refuses to continue with his scheme. A dishevelled Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months. He tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo , a town on the Mexican Pacific coast, where he can start anew. He asks Red to promise, once he is released, to travel to a specific hayfield near Buxton and recover a package that Andy buried there. Red worries that Andy is suicidal, especially after learning that he asked a fellow inmate for a rope. At the next day's roll call , the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over 19 years.

After years of persistent letters, a library donation arrives, and the banker plays music over the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before being punished with solitary confinement. He explains to his friend that hope sustains him through his sentence. In the 1960s, the warden begins exploiting prison labor for profit, with the banker laundering money under an alias. They befriend a young inmate whom the banker helps educate. The inmate reveals information about the original murder, but when the banker informs the warden, the inmate is killed, and the banker is threatened into continuing the money laundering scheme. After months in solitary confinement, he shares his dream of starting anew in a coastal town and asks his friend to retrieve a buried package upon his release. The next day, he escapes through a tunnel he had secretly dug over 19 years, stealing evidence of the warden's corruption and withdrawing laundered money from banks. He mails evidence to a newspaper, leading to the warden's suicide and the guard's arrest. The following year, his friend is paroled and, remembering his promise, travels to retrieve the package and eventually finds the banker living freely on a beach, where they reunite and embrace."

Phil meets with magazine publisher John Minify, who asks Green, a gentile , to write an article on antisemitism . At first, he is not enthusiastic about the story. At a lunch party, Phil meets Minify's niece Kathy Lacey, who is actually the person who suggested the story idea. The next day, at home, Phil admits his surprise after learning that the idea came from \"a girl\". His mother mocks him for his anti-female prejudice. Phil then tries to explain anti-Jewish prejudice to his son. Realizing how difficult it is to explain these topics, he decides to write the story. Phil and Kathy begin dating and Phil adopts a Jewish identity to write the story from a fresh perspective. They agree to keep it secret that Phil is not Jewish. Despite seeming to have liberal views, Kathy is taken aback after learning of Phil's plan. Phil is assigned a secretary, Elaine Wales, who turns out to be Jewish. Being told there were no openings at the magazine after she applied under her true name, she reapplied using an anglicized named and was hired. After learning of Wales' experience from Phil, Minify orders the magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Phil meets fashion editor Anne Dettrey, who becomes a good friend and potentially more, particularly as strains develop between Phil and Kathy. After completing his service in WWII, Dave Goldman, Phil's childhood friend, moves to New York and lives with the Greens while searching for a job and a home for his family. Being Jewish, Dave also experiences antisemitism. Housing is scarce in the city, but it is particularly difficult for him, since not all landlords will rent to a Jewish family. While researching his story, Phil experiences several incidents of bigotry. When Phil's mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with a Jewish name. After hearing Phil is Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves. In addition, the janitor is shocked that Phil has added a Jewish name (Greenberg), below his name (Green), on the mail box. Furthermore, when Phil wants to celebrate his honeymoon at a swanky hotel, the manager refuses to register Phil, whom he tells to go elsewhere. Tommy also becomes the target of bullies because of this. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles Tommy, telling him their taunts of \"dirty Jew\" are wrong because he is not Jewish, not that the epithet is wrong in and of itself. Kathy's attitudes are revealed further when she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane invites them to a celebration in her home in Darien , which is known to be a community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene, Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil only pretends to be Jewish, but he dissuades her. At the party, everyone is friendly to Phil, though many people cancel at the last minute. Dave announces he will have to quit his job because he cannot find a residence for his family. Kathy owns a vacant cottage in Darien and Phil sees it as a solution to Dave's problem. Kathy, however, is unwilling to offend her neighbors by renting it to a Jewish family. Phil breaks his engagement to her and announces he will be moving away from New York when his article is published. When it comes out, it is well received by the magazine staff. Kathy meets with Dave and tells him how sick she felt when a party guest told a bigoted joke. However, she has no answer when Dave asks her what she did about it. She realizes that remaining silent condones the prejudice. The next day, Dave announces that he and his family will be moving into the cottage in Darien and Kathy will be moving in with her sister next door to make sure they are treated well. Moved by this, Phil reconciles with Kathy. His mother, still recovering from her heart condition, tells Phil that his article has given her new hope for the future, a new motivation to get well.",

However, when he shares the news with Joanna, his wife of eight years, she shocks him by announcing she is leaving him. She walks out of the apartment without Billy, the couple's seven-year-old son, because she feels she is unfit to be a mother. The next morning when Billy asks about his mother, Ted explains that she went away to be alone for a while. Ted drops off Billy at his elementary school, asking him what grade he attends, and leaves him with a woman at the entrance before rushing to work. At the ad agency, Ted confides in Jim O'Connor, his boss and friend. Jim is understanding but makes clear that Ted's situation must not interfere with his new responsibility as the lead person on the Mid-Atlantic Airlines account. Initially, Ted and Billy struggle to adapt to their new living situation as Billy misses his mother and Ted has to do the housework usually done by Joanna. Father and son gradually settle into a routine, but Ted’s work suffers. Billy and Ted have a fight one evening when Billy refuses to eat Salisbury steak and has ice cream instead, resulting in Billy crying for his mother. They later reconcile. When Billy worries that his mother’s departure is his fault, Ted assures him that Joanna left because she was not happy in the marriage. Meanwhile, Ted has become good friends with divorced neighbor Margaret Phelps, with whom Joanna was a confidante. One day, Billy has an accident when he falls off a jungle gym . Ted rushes him to the hospital and asks the doctor to let him stay by his son's side as he receives stitches. After fifteen months, Ted receives a call from Joanna and meets her at a restaurant. Joanna reveals that she is happier after working in California and seeing a therapist. When she states that she is now ready to raise her son and wants Billy to live with her, Ted becomes furious and leaves. He consults with a divorce attorney John Shaunessy, who cautions that the court usually awards custody to the mother when the child is young. At work, Jim notifies Ted the agency is letting him go because the Mid-Atlantic Airlines executives are displeased with his work. Knowing he has no chance at custody if he is unemployed, Ted tries to land a job within twenty-four hours, despite few ad firms hiring during the holiday season. He convinces two agency executives to consider his application immediately and accepts a lower-salaried position for which he is overqualified. The custody hearing begins. In court, Joanna asserts that Ted never abused her or was unfaithful, but she lost her self-esteem as a stay-at-home mother. She insists she has since \"become a whole person again\" and believes her son needs her more than he does his father. Ted states that he has proven that he can parent as well as Joanna and insists that taking Billy away could cause \"irreparable\" harm. The legal battle becomes contentious when the attorneys resort to character assassinations . Shaunessy brings Joanna to tears by forcing her to admit that she was part of the marriage's failure. Ted also admits he made mistakes as a father and husband. However, his job loss and Billy's accident are used to discredit him. Ted expresses resentment at Joanna for her attorney's aggressive tactics. Margaret testifies on behalf of Ted and implores Joanna to recognize that he has become a great father. Later, Ted learns that  Joanna was awarded custody. He decides not to appeal in order to spare Billy the burden of testifying in court. Billy becomes upset as Ted explains that they will still see each other, even though Billy will be living with his mother. On the morning Joanna is scheduled to pick up Billy, she sees Ted in the lobby alone and tearfully reveals that she is relinquishing custody because she does not want to take Billy away from his home.

    "plot": "Elmer Gantry is a hard-drinking, fast-talking traveling salesman with a charismatic personality who infuses biblical passages and fervor into his pitches as a way to ease and collect money. He is drawn to the roadshow of Sister Sharon Falconer and is immediately attracted to the revivalist's saintly aura. As the troupe leaves town for Kansas , Gantry sweet talks her naïve assistant Sister Rachel into disclosing information regarding Falconer's past, which he uses to con his way into her good graces. He joins the troupe preaching \"Christ in commerce\" and how he is a saved salesman. Gantry and Falconer develop a \" good cop/bad cop \" routine, with Gantry telling the audience members that they will burn in Hell for their sins and Falconer promising salvation if they repent . Because of Gantry's fire and brimstone sermons, the group comes to the attention of the church council in Zenith, Winnemac , a larger city. Though Falconer's manager Bill Morgan does not think that she is ready to preach outside of the smaller venues, Gantry convinces her to go to Zenith. They meet with the church leaders, most of whom are wary of turning religion into a spectacle as Gantry does, but he convinces them that the churches must earn money to stay open and can increase their membership only if prospective members are first won over to Christ by attending Gantry's colorful revival meetings. Traveling along with Falconer is big-city reporter Jim Lefferts, who is torn between his disgust for religious hucksterism and his admiration for Gantry's charm and cunning . As Gantry's sermons bring Falconer's group to larger venues, Lefferts writes a series of articles labeling the revival a sham, and reveals that neither Falconer nor Gantry has any credentials. Falconer eventually admits to Gantry that her real name is Katie Jones, and that her origins are humbler than she publicly admits. Falconer also becomes Gantry's lover and loses her virginity to him. The success of the Falconer-Gantry team comes to the attention of Lulu Bains, who became a prostitute when her youthful affair with Gantry ruined her standing in her minister father's eyes and Gantry ditched her. Acting as a moralist, Gantry unwittingly invades the brothel where Lulu works, but sends the prostitutes out of town when he sees Lulu. When he meets Lulu privately after she phones him, Lulu wants revenge against Gantry for running out on her in Kansas. Her love for Gantry returns, however,  when confronting him, and they embrace. A hidden photographer planted by Lulu records their embrace, but Gantry's love for Falconer prevents him from consummating his relationship with Lulu. Lulu  proceeds to frame Gantry out of jealousy for his love for Falconer. Lulu blackmails him, and Falconer is asked to bring $25,000 in exchange for the negatives of the incriminating pictures. Falconer brings the money, but Lulu refuses to accept it, and the pictures are then printed on the front page of the town's newspaper. Lulu had at first offered Lefferts the exclusive story of Gantry's supposed sexual indiscretion, but he refused, shrugging off the pictures as merely proof that Gantry is as human as anyone else. An angry mob ransacks the tent revival following the publication of the incriminating photos in another newspaper, with Lulu witnessing Gantry's humiliation. As the mob curses Gantry and smears him with eggs and produce , Lulu is emotionally shaken and flees the scene. She returns to the brothel, which is now in a dilapidated state from Gantry's publicity stunt. Her pimp is there to collect the $25,000, but when Lulu tells him that she did not take Falconer's money, he beats her. Gantry comes to Lulu's rescue. He disposes of the pimp and apologizes to Lulu, who later publicly confesses to having framed Gantry. Gantry returns to Falconer as a capacity crowd of followers fills her new tabernacle following Gantry's redemption in the press. Falconer declines Gantry's request to abandon her soul-saving ventures, insisting that she and Gantry were brought together by God to do His work. After Falconer appears to cure a follower of deafness, a fire that had been smoldering erupts suddenly. Unable or unwilling to see past her own religious zeal as flames engulf her tabernacle, Falconer remains on the premises and dies. The next day, Gantry, saddened by Falconer's death, leads a spiritual with her followers after their prodding. Morgan asks Gantry to continue Falconer's ministry, but Gantry replies, quoting St Paul: \"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child:  but when I became a man, I put away childish things\".

Later, he spares the life of a gas station owner for correctly calling a coin toss . Meanwhile, Llewelyn Moss is hunting pronghorns in the desert. He comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, finding several dead men, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, drugs in a truck, and a briefcase containing $2 million in cash. He takes the briefcase and returns home. Feeling guilty, he returns with water that night but finds the man has been murdered. He looks up to the ridge and sees two men with guns who pursue him in a truck. He escapes by diving into a river. After making his way back home, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother. Chigurh is hired to recover the missing money; meanwhile, Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell begins investigating the failed drug deal. Chigurh searches Moss' trailer home, using his bolt pistol to blow out the door lock. Moss takes a taxi to a motel in Del Rio , where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. After Moss returns to the motel after purchasing new boots, he sees the curtains in his room in a different position from when he left, and rightly assumes he has been found. Following a tracking device hidden in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss' motel and kills three Mexican mobsters who were waiting for Moss in his room. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to his first room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct. Moving to a hotel in the border town of Eagle Pass , Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, badly wounding both and killing a truck driver. Moss flees to Mexico, hiding the case along the Rio Grande . Chigurh cleans and stitches his wounds with stolen supplies. Carson Wells, a bounty hunter , visits a wounded Moss in a Mexican hospital, and offers protection from Chigurh in exchange for the money, but Moss refuses. Chigurh ambushes Wells at his hotel. The phone rings as Wells is bartering for his life. Chigurh shoots him and takes the call from Moss, vowing to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money. Moss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in El Paso , where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean's mother unknowingly reveals Moss' location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel in El Paso, only to find that the Mexicans have killed Moss. Carla Jean arrives later and weeps when Bell somberly removes his hat. Bell visits his cousin Ellis and tells him he plans to retire because he feels overmatched by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell that he cannot evade fate, and only vanity makes him think otherwise. That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and sees the lock blown out. Chigurh appears to be on the other side of the door holding his shotgun. Bell hesitantly enters and finds the room empty, and notices that the room's air duct has been opened. Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. Chigurh says he must fulfill his vow, but offers a coin toss as a compromise. Carla Jean refuses to call it, saying that he will be responsible for her fate. Chigurh checks the soles of his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, another car crashes into him, breaking his arm. He pays a passing boy for the shirt off his back to use as a sling, and limps away. Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, as he rode horseback through a snowy mountain pass, his father rode past him carrying fire in a horn, and he knew his father would prepare a campfire ahead for both of them.",

Sally's estranged husband Dave and her pregnant sister Chrissie show up one day with the intention of selling a $10,000 (equivalent to $38,000 in 2024) bag of cocaine he had stolen from a mob dead drop in Philadelphia . Sally is outraged to see him, as he had impregnated Chrissie and run off with her. Dave meets Lou, an aging former gangster who lives in Sally's apartment building and runs a small time numbers game in poor areas of the city; Lou also acts as a caretaker for Grace, a seemingly bedridden, aging beauty queen whose gangster husband he used to work under, and who constantly berates and demeans him.

Sally and Lou make love one day, but she returns to her apartment to find it trashed; she has been tracked down by Dave's killers, who beat her to find out if she has the drugs. They leave, but Lou laments not being able to protect her. Grace also reveals that Lou was a small-time crook and nowhere near as competent as he pretends.

That night, from a motel, they watch the TV news reporting on the killing. A police sketch of the suspect is shown. It looks nothing like Lou. Lou is overjoyed with relief and pride. He confesses to Sally that this was the first time he has ever killed anyone. At the motel the next morning, Lou takes the phone to the bathroom to call Grace and brag about the killings. Sally wakes and takes half of the money with the intention of sneaking off; Lou witnesses this, allowing her to leave and giving her the car keys so she can escape to France, rather than go to Miami with him. Lou returns to Atlantic City to be with Grace. Working together, they sell the remaining portion of the cocaine and walk off arm in arm with renewed respect for each other.",

    "plot": "Thomas Becket is an advisor and companion of the carousing King Henry II . Henry appoints Becket as Lord Chancellor to have a close confidant in this position whom he can completely control. Henry is less interested in his royal duties than drunken forays in the royal hunting grounds and pursuing peasant women. He becomes increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry's court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry's Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as Henry's wife Queen Eleanor and Henry's mother Empress Matilda , who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the King. Henry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property to support Henry's military campaigns in France. During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives news that the archbishop has died. In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop, and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice. Shortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry's most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refused to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution. The King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral. He lays out his plan to remove Becket through scandal and innuendo, which the envious Bishop of London quickly agrees to. These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers and announces that as Archbishop he will petition the Pope for an ecclesiastical trial, causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of having his friend turn into his enemy. Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis . King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favourite pastime, tormenting the English. Louis provides refuge for Becket at the Abbey of Saint Martin while the English send emissaries to retrieve Becket. Becket then travels to the Vatican , where he begs the Pope to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England. Henry then rapidly sinks into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons, who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. During a drunken rage, Henry asks \" Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest? \" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury , where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks. Henry, fresh from his whipping, informs the barons that the ones who killed Becket will be found and justly punished. He then publicly proclaims to the crowd outside the church his arrangement for Thomas Becket to be canonised as a saint.",

He invites her to a New Year's Eve party at the mansion, and the following day, he offers her $15,000 to be his girlfriend for a week. During the week, Anora parties with Vanya and his friends, and they all go on an extravagant trip to Las Vegas. At the end of the trip, Vanya reveals that he has to return to Russia permanently to work at his father's company and expresses disdain for his parents. He suggests that he will not have to leave if he marries an American and impulsively proposes marriage. Anora is reluctant at first but agrees after Vanya assures her that his feelings are genuine. They elope at a Vegas wedding chapel. Vanya then buys her a large wedding ring and an expensive fur coat. She resigns from her job and moves into Vanya's mansion. When news of their marriage reaches Russia, Vanya's mother, Galina, orders his Armenian godfather, Toros, to find them and arrange an annulment while she and his father, Nikolai, fly to the U.S. Toros sends his henchmen, Garnik and Igor, to the mansion. They inform Vanya that his parents are taking him back to Russia and enrage Anora by calling her a prostitute, suggesting Vanya only married her for a green card . Vanya flees the premises, and Anora engages in a violent struggle with Garnik and Igor before they restrain her. When Toros arrives, he tells Anora that Vanya's mansion and wealth belong to his parents and that he is immature and financially dependent on them.

Conceding to his parents, Vanya coldly tells Anora their marriage must end while Galina orders everyone onto a plane to Las Vegas. Having not signed a prenuptial agreement , Anora pledges to file for a divorce settlement, but Galina threatens her with financial ruin if she does not comply. Realizing Vanya's cowardice and his family's power, Anora signs the annulment papers. Igor suggests Vanya apologize to Anora, but Galina objects. Anora insults both Vanya and Galina before leaving, telling Galina that Vanya only married her to spite her, much to Nikolai's amusement. Igor takes Anora back to New York to collect her belongings. At the mansion, she confronts Igor about their encounter, accusing him of assault and saying he would have raped her if they had been alone; Igor assures her he is simply not a rapist and had no intention of doing so. The next morning, Igor gives Anora the money Toros promised her and drives her home. In the car, he returns her wedding ring as a token of goodwill.

Natalie Keener, a young, ambitious new hire, promotes cutting costs by conducting layoffs via video-conferencing . Ryan raises concerns that the new system is impersonal and undignified, arguing that Natalie lacks understanding about the firing process and how to handle emotionally vulnerable people. His boss, Craig Gregory, has Natalie accompany a reluctant Ryan on his next round of terminations to observe the process. Ryan tutors Natalie on traveling more efficiently using smaller luggage and moving quickly through airport security. As they travel together, Natalie challenges Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly regarding relationships and love, but Ryan defends his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie's boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message . Ryan and Alex comfort the shattered Natalie. On a video termination test run, Ryan's earlier concerns prove valid; when one laid-off person breaks down on camera, Natalie is unable to properly console him. Natalie castigates Ryan for his inability to commit to Alex, despite their obvious compatibility; he dismisses her criticisms and chastises her for lacking empathy and never appreciating her surroundings. Before returning home, Ryan, taking Alex along, heads to Wisconsin for his sister Julie's wedding. He has a strained reunion with his semi-estranged family, who resent his absence. When Jim, the groom, gets cold feet just prior to the ceremony, Ryan's older sister, Kara, asks him to intervene. Although counter to his personal philosophy, Ryan uses his motivational skills to persuade Jim to proceed with the wedding. Ryan begins questioning his lifestyle and philosophies, and doubts what he lectures others about. In Las Vegas for a prestigious speaking engagement, he abruptly walks offstage mid-presentation and impulsively flies to Chicago to see Alex. Arriving at her front door, he is stunned to discover that she is married and has children. She later phones, chastising him for nearly wrecking her marriage, and says her family is her real life; he is merely an escape. On Ryan's flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten-million mile mark. The airline's chief pilot is aboard to personally congratulate Ryan and notes he is the youngest person to achieve the milestone. When asked where he is from, Ryan, realizing he has no real home, simply says, \"here.\" Back in Omaha, Ryan transfers a million frequent flyer miles to Julie and Jim so they can have a honeymoon. Craig informs Ryan that a laid-off employee has committed suicide (someone who had earlier threatened to do so whilst being terminated by Natalie and Ryan). Natalie, upset over the news, quits via text message. The remote-layoff program is stopped, and Ryan is sent back on the road. Natalie applies to the same San Francisco company where she had previously declined a position, due to having followed her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. Impressed by her qualifications and Ryan's glowing written recommendation, the interviewer hires her. The film concludes with Ryan at the airport, standing in front of a vast destination board, contemplating where he should travel next (something Natalie encouraged him to do earlier).

    "plot": "In 1936, amid the Great Depression , grifter Johnny Hooker and his partners, Luther Coleman and Joe Erie, con $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim in Joliet, Illinois . Hooker loses his share of the con on a rigged roulette game, while Luther, buoyed by the windfall, decides to retire. He tells Hooker to seek out his old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago, to learn \"the big con\". Corrupt Joliet police lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing that their mark was a courier for vicious Irish-American crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Lonnegan's men murder Luther and the courier. After finding Luther dead, Hooker flees to Chicago. Hooker finds Gondorff drunk and in hiding from the FBI , running a carousel that is a front for a brothel , and asks for help taking down Lonnegan. Initially reluctant, Gondorff relents and recruits a team of experienced con men. They decide to resurrect an elaborate, obsolete scam known as \"the wire\", using a large crew to create a phony off-track betting parlor. Snyder and Lonnegan's men track Hooker to Chicago; Gondorff warns Hooker that if either of them finds him, the con will have to be called off. Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited , Gondorff, posing as the boorish Chicago bookie \"Shaw\", buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes poker game, being facilitated by the train's conductor. \"Shaw\" infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then cheats him out of $15,000 ($339,892 in 2024 ). Hooker, posing as \"Shaw's\" disgruntled employee \"Kelly\", is sent to collect the winnings and convince Lonnegan to help him take over \"Shaw's\" operation – a tactic Lonnegan has used repeatedly to build his crime empire. Hooker returns home to find Lonnegan's men waiting to assassinate him, but he avoids their efforts. Their attempt spooks Gondorff, but Hooker convinces him to keep the con alive. Lonnegan, frustrated with his men's inability to kill Hooker for the Joliet con – and unaware that \"Kelly\" is Hooker – orders the job to be given to Salino, his best assassin. A mysterious figure, wearing black leather gloves, begins to follow and observe Hooker. Meanwhile, Snyder's pursuit of Hooker attracts the attention of undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders Snyder to bring Hooker in to entrap Gondorff. \"Kelly\" gives Lonnegan a tip on a 7-to-1 long shot in a horse race that pays off. When Lonnegan presses him for details, he reveals that he has a partner, \"Les Harmon\" (actually con man Kid Twist), in the Chicago Western Union office, who will help them topple \"Shaw\" by winning bets he books on horse races through past-posting . Lonnegan is convinced after being provided the trifecta of another race, and agrees to finance a $500,000 bet ($11.3 million in 2024 ) to break \"Shaw\" and get revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before Polk, who forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to jail Luther Coleman's widow. Feeling despondent the night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with a diner waitress named Loretta. The next morning, as she walks toward him in an alley, the black-gloved man appears and shoots her dead before she can shoot Hooker. The man reveals to Hooker that Gondorff hired him to protect him, and that the waitress was, in fact, Salino. After \"Harmon\" telephones directions to \"Place it on Lucky Dan\", Lonnegan bets $500,000 at \"Shaw's\" parlor on the horse named Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, \"Harmon\" arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet: when he said \"place it\", he meant that the horse would \"place\" (i.e., finish second ). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes to the teller window and demands his money back, at which point Polk, Snyder, and a half-dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk tells Hooker he is free to go. Shocked at the betrayal, Gondorff shoots Hooker. Polk shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise (\"bleeding\" only from fake bullets ) amid cheers and laughter: \"Polk\" is actually Hickey, a fellow con man, who has been running a con on the con, with his \"FBI agents\" to divert Snyder and ensure that Lonnegan abandons the money without ever realizing he was taken.

Vogler cannot recognize the first two (which Salieri wrote) but is relieved to recognize the third ( Eine kleine Nachtmusik ) at once. Salieri peevishly reveals that Mozart wrote it. Salieri begins his confession by saying that he grew up hearing stories of the child prodigy, Mozart. In his youth, Salieri was in love with music but was forbidden by his father from studying the craft. Salieri proposed that if God made him a famous musician like Mozart, he would give God his faithfulness, chastity , and diligence. Salieri's father soon dies, which he interprets as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri becomes court composer to Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II in Vienna . However, he has enough taste to know that Emperor Joseph has no ear for music and that his own compositions will not stand the test of time. Upon their first meeting, Salieri immediately knows that Mozart is the better composer but is shocked to learn that Mozart is obscene, immature, and dissolute. He also learns that Mozart never needs to pen a second draft of his music, implying divine inspiration . [ a ] Salieri cannot fathom why God would choose a reprobate like Mozart as his earthly instrument. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on him by destroying Mozart. Mozart's work is ahead of its time, and he has trouble finding employment in Vienna. He spends himself into debt, alarming his wife Constanze . [ b ] Salieri and Mozart bond over their shared contempt for Emperor Joseph's lack of taste, but Mozart is unimpressed by Salieri's populist work, which causes Salieri great pain. Mozart boldly adapts the subversive play The Marriage of Figaro into a comedic opera. Salieri rejoices, thinking Mozart's career is ruined, but Mozart stuns Salieri by convincing the Emperor to approve the project. However, the Emperor finds the opera boring, and it is cancelled. Eventually, Mozart's father, Leopold , passes away. In response to criticisms and his grief, Mozart composes Don Giovanni , a dark, serious opera. Salieri is entranced but vindictively gets that opera cancelled, too. Renouncing Vienna's artistic establishment, Mozart agrees to write The Magic Flute for a commoners' theater against Constanze's wishes. After watching Don Giovanni five times, Salieri realizes that the dead commander who accuses Giovanni of sin represents Mozart's inferiority complex towards his father. He concocts a plan to humiliate God. He persuades the unstable Mozart that his late father has risen to commission a Requiem Mass. He plans to kill Mozart, claim the Requiem as his own, and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, forcing God to listen as Salieri is acclaimed. Mozart overworks himself, juggling The Magic Flute and the Requiem . Constanze, who wants him to focus on the Requiem but is fearful of his erratic behaviour, leaves with their son Karl . Although The Magic Flute is a success, the dying Mozart collapses before he can finish the Requiem .

    "plot": "During World War II, newly commissioned Ensign Willis Seward \"Willie\" Keith reports to the minesweeper USS Caine , where he meets career officer Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, the ship’s executive officer, and aspiring novelist and communications officer Lieutenant Thomas Keefer. Soon after, Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg is assigned command of the Caine . The eccentric Queeg instills strict discipline on the lax crew, making him unpopular with them, but admired by Keith. During a gunnery target towing exercise, Queeg is distracted berating Keith and Keefer over a crewman’s appearance, resulting in the ship steering over the towline, setting the target adrift. Queeg tries to cover up the incident. Assigned to escort a group of landing craft during an invasion of a small Pacific island , Queeg abandons his mission before he reaches the designated departure point, and instead orders the dropping of a yellow dye marker, leaving the landing craft to fend for themselves. Queeg asks his officers for their support, but they remain silent and nickname him \"Old Yellowstain\", which implies cowardice. Keefer, believing Queeg to be paranoid , encourages Maryk to consider relieving Queeg on the basis of mental incapacity under Article 184 of Navy Regulations . Though Maryk angrily rejects that possibility, he does begin keeping a medical log documenting the captain's behavior. When strawberries go missing from the officers' mess, Queeg convenes an elaborate investigation to determine the culprit. The investigation involves searching the ship and stripping all crew members. Convinced of Queeg's instability, Maryk asks Keefer and Keith to go with him to see Admiral Halsey about the matter. Arriving aboard Halsey's flagship, Keefer backs down and they return to the ship. At the height of a typhoon , Maryk urges the captain to reverse course into the wind and take on ballast, but Queeg refuses and virtually freezes up on the bridge. Maryk, supported by Keith, relieves Queeg of command under Article 184. The Caine returns to San Francisco, where Maryk and Keith face a court-martial for mutiny . Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a temporarily grounded naval aviator and an attorney before entering the Navy, becomes Maryk's defense counsel. At the court-martial, Keefer claims he never observed any mental illness in Queeg and was \"flabbergasted\" when he was relieved. Under Greenwald's relentless cross-examination, Queeg exhibits odd behavior on the stand, including his habit of rolling two steel balls in his hand symbolizing his mental instability, and Maryk is acquitted. Following the acquittal, the officers of the Caine hold a party, where Keefer receives a frosty reception from Maryk. A drunken Greenwald arrives and berates all the officers for not appreciating Queeg's long service and failing to give him the support he asked for, instead of deriding him as an incompetent. Greenwald claims their mistreatment of Queeg, who had been suffering from \" battle fatigue \" from his previous combat service in the Atlantic, caused the captain to ultimately become indecisive during the typhoon. He denounces Keefer as the real \"author\" of the mutiny and throws a glass of champagne, the \"yellow wine\", in Keefer's face. The rest of the officers walk out, leaving Keefer alone in the room. Keith, now married to his girlfriend May Wynn, is promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade) , and assigned to a new Sumner -class destroyer commanded by now-Commander De Vriess, his first captain on the Caine .",

    "plot": "Act One A beautiful young woman named Hermia is in love with Lysander and wishes to marry him. Her father Egeus, however, has instructed her to marry Demetrius, whom he has chosen for her. When Hermia refuses to obey, stating she is in love with Lysander, her father invokes before Duke Theseus of Athens an ancient Athenian law that states a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or face death. Theseus offers her another choice—to live a life of chastity as a nun and worship the goddess Diana. Meanwhile, Peter Quince and his fellow players gather to produce a stage play about the cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe in honor of the Duke and his upcoming marriage to Hippolyta. Quince reads the names of characters and assigns them to the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and suggests himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. He also prefers being a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles. Quince ends the meeting instructing his players to meet at the Duke's oak tree. In the forest outside Athens, Oberon, the king of the fairies, and Titania his queen, are having an argument. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there to attend the wedding of Duke Theseus and Hippolyta. Oberon and Titania are estranged: She refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his knight because the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Wanting to punish Titania's disobedience, Oberon instructs his mischievous court jester Puck to retrieve a flower called \"love-in-idleness\". Originally a white flower, it turns purple when struck by Cupid's bow. When someone applies the magical love potion to a sleeping person's eyelids, it makes the victim fall in love with the first living creature seen upon awakening. Oberon comes across a sleeping Titania and applies the love potion to her eyes. He intends to make Titania fall in love with the first creature she sees when waking up, which he is sure will be an animal of the forest. Oberon's intent is to shame Titania into giving up the little Indian changeling. Meanwhile, Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping. Demetrius, who is also in love with Hermia, pursues them into the forest. He is followed by Helena, who is desperate to reclaim Demetrius' love. Helena continues to make advances toward Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia, but he rebuffs her with cruel insults. When Oberon sees this, he orders Puck to spread some of the love potion on the eyelids of Demetrius. When Puck later discovers the sleeping Lysander, he mistakes him for Demetrius—not having seen either before—and administers the love potion to the sleeping Lysander. During the night, Helena comes across the sleeping Lysander and wakes him up while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. When he lays eyes on her, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Meanwhile, the mischievous Puck turns Bottom into a donkey (from the neck up). When Titania wakes up and lays eyes on Bottom as a donkey, she falls in love with him. Oberon finds the abandoned changeling and takes him away. Act Two When Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia, he instructs Puck to bring Helena to him while he applies the love potion to the sleeping Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, Demetrius sees Helena, and now both Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Helena, who is convinced that her two suitors are simply mocking her. When Hermia encounters Helena with her two suitors, she accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her. The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel each other to prove whose love for Helena is the greatest. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander. After Puck applies the potion to the sleeping Lysander's eyes, he returns to loving Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena. And Titania is still in love with the donkey-headed Bottom. Oberon leads all the fairies away with the changeling at his side. Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania from her spell and they leave together in love once again. Following Oberon's instructions, Puck removes the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so that Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena all believe that they have been dreaming when they awaken. Together they return from the forest to attend the wedding of Duke Theseus and Hippolyta. When Theseus sees Hermia and her father Egeus, and seeing that Demetrius does not love Hermia any more, Theseus overrules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding—Hermia to marry Lysander, and Helena to marry Demetrius. The lovers decide that the previous night's events must have been a dream. That night at the wedding, they all watch Bottom and his fellow players perform Pyramus and Thisbe . Unprepared as they are, the performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy. Before the encore, the guests sneak away and retire to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and the other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After everyone leaves, Puck suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing but a dream.",

Valentin reacts with humor and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy is on the front page of Variety with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" She capitalizes by auditioning as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from studio boss Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry. With a little guidance from Valentin, who draws a beauty spot on her cheek, Peppy rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles. Two years later, Zimmer announces plans to cease production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, he begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience) but cannot speak himself. He decides to leave the studio for the chance to produce, finance, and direct his own silent film, Tears of Love . The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film Beauty Spot and the 1929 stock market crash . Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately, audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, while only a few people attend Valentin's. With Valentin ruined, his wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy quickly becomes the first of several major new Hollywood sound film stars. Later, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid the loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him his car before firing him. Depressed and drunk, Valentin sets fire to a stack of his old films. As the nitrate film blazes out of control, he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued, Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. His ego hurt, Valentin shows ingratitude for Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to remind him of his changing luck. Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if he does not agree. After Valentin learns that Peppy bought his possessions at auction, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide. She tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace, and Valentin tells her it is no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let her make a musical production so Valentin can avoid the humiliation of having to speak. Now the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a French accent .

She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant to write a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case. In 1951, Philomena became pregnant after having sex with a man she did not know at a county fair, so was sent by her father to Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in Ireland. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the convent laundry for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years. She believed the man at the fair had been married to her mother's neighbour and that he had been watching her from afar, often following her home at night. Martin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to wealthy Americans. Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the United States so invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed Michael A. Hess , who became a lawyer and senior official in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years. Philomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael to learn more about him from them. Visiting a former colleague of Michael's they discover that Michael was gay and died of AIDS . They also visit his 'sister' Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent, and learn that they were both emotionally and physically abused by their adoptive parents, and hear about Michael’s partner, Pete Olsson. After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows her some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, so had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery. Philomena and Martin return to the convent to ask where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's pleas, Martin angrily forces his way into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to Anthony and denying him the chance to finally reunite with Philomena, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of wedlock. Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. She then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway.",

Her father is an invalid employed as a clerk in a factory owned by Mr. Lamb, who has kept Adams on salary for years despite his lengthy illness. Her mother is embittered by her husband's lack of ambition and upset by the snubs endured by her daughter because of their poverty. Alice's older brother Walter is a gambler who cannot hold a job. Alice attends a dance given by the wealthy Mildred Palmer. She has no date, and she is escorted to the occasion by Walter. Alice, a social climber like her mother, engages in socially-inappropriate behavior and conversation in an attempt to impress others. At the dance, Alice meets wealthy Arthur Russell, who is charmed by her despite her poverty. Alice's mother nags her husband into quitting his job and pouring his life savings into a glue factory. Mr. Lamb ostracizes Mr. Adams from society in the belief that Adams stole the glue formula from him. Alice is the subject of cruel town gossip, which Russell ignores. Alice invites Russell to the Adams home for a fancy meal. She and her mother put on airs, the entire family dresses inappropriately in formal wear despite the hot summer night, and the Adamses pretend that they eat caviar and fancy rich-tasting food all the time. The dinner is ruined by Alice's inability to keep up the lie, but she blames the situation on the supposed slovenly behavior and poor cooking skills of Malena, the maid hired by the Adamses for the occasion. Mr. Adams unwittingly embarrasses Alice by exposing the many lies she has told Russell. When Walter shows up with bad financial news, Alice gently expels Russell from the house now that everything is \"ruined.\" Walter claims that \"a friend of mine got in a jam,\" and to help his friend, Walter has stolen $150 from Mr. Lamb. (The obvious implication is that Walter stole the money to pay off his own gambling debts.) Mr. Adams decides to take a loan against his new factory to save Walter from jail. Just then, Mr. Lamb appears at the Adams house, accuses Adams of stealing the glue formula from him, and declares his intention to ruin Adams by building a glue factory directly across the street from the Adams plant. The men argue violently, but their friendship is saved when Alice confesses that her parents took the glue formula only so that she could have a better life and some social status. Lamb and Adams reconcile, and Lamb indicates that he will not prosecute Walter. Alice wanders onto the porch, where Russell has been waiting for her. He confesses his love for her despite her poverty and family problems.",

Though the Draytons are liberal-minded, they are shocked that their daughter is engaged to a man of a different race. Christina gradually accepts the situation, but Matt objects because of the likely unhappiness and seemingly insurmountable problems the couple will face.

    "plot": "In 1939, in Fascist Italy , young Italian Jew Guido Orefice arrives to work in Arezzo , Tuscany , with his uncle Eliseo in a hotel restaurant. He is comical and sharp, and falls in love with the gentile girl Dora. Later, Guido sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to Rodolfo, a rich but arrogant local government official with whom he regularly clashes. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Eventually, Dora gives in to Guido's affection and promise. Guido steals her from her engagement party on Uncle Eliseo's horse, Robin Hood, humiliating Dora's fiancé and mother. They are later married, have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore. Dora's mother visits once, meeting her grandson. In 1944, at the height of World War II , Nazi Germany occupies Northern Italy . Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosuè are arrested on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Italian Jews are forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora insists on boarding the train to stay with her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora never sees her family during their internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as hijacking the camp's loudspeaker to send messages, symbolic or literal, to Dora to assure her that he and Giosuè are safe. Eliseo is murdered in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to bathe, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to \"take a shower\". Guido consistently hides the true situation from Giosuè. He convinces him that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks given to him. Each task earns them points and whoever reaches one thousand points first wins a tank. He is told that if he cries, complains for his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido continually encourages him. One day, Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game. Then he tricks a German nanny into thinking Giosuè is one of her charges to feed him while Guido serves the German officers. Giosuè must stay quiet at all times for this part of the game and simply follow the other children, as he cannot speak German. Giosuè is almost exposed as a prisoner when he accidentally says \"thank you\" in Italian to another server at dinner. However, when they return with his superior, Guido provides a ruse by teaching all of the German children how to say \"thank you\" in Italian, saving Giosuè. Guido maintains this story through the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay hidden until everybody has left, the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but is caught by a German soldier. An officer orders his execution, so he is led off by the soldier. As he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from hiding, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. An overjoyed Giosuè, unaware of his father's death, believes he won the tank, and an American soldier allows him to ride with him on it. Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with her. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the movie's narrator reveals himself as the adult Giosuè, reminiscing on the sacrifices his father made for him.",

Mitchell , the Attorney General, appoints Tom Foran and Richard Schultz as the prosecutors, while all the defendants except Seale are represented by William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass . Judge Julius Hoffman shows significant prejudice for the prosecution, especially insisting that he and Abbie Hoffman are not related. Seale's attorney, Charles Garry , cannot attend due to illness, leading Judge Hoffman to insist that Kunstler represent him. This insistence is rejected by both Kunstler and Seale. Seale receives support from Fred Hampton which Judge Hoffman assumes is legal help. Abbie Hoffman openly antagonizes the court. Judge Hoffman removes two jurors who he suspects sympathize with the defendants due to alleged threats from the Black Panther Party and charges the defendants and their attorneys with  multiple counts of contempt of court .

When trying to return to the park, police had taken control of the hill with orders to disperse the crowd leading to a riot between police and protesters. Days later, the defendants learn that Fred Hampton was killed during a police raid. In retaliation for Seale continuing to speak up for his constitutional rights, Judge Hoffman has him taken to another room, beaten, and returned gagged and chained. This causes the defense and the prosecution to object, and Judge Hoffman declares Seale's case a mistrial . The defense puts Ramsey Clark , Attorney General during the riots, on the stand.

At the dance, Sonny kisses Ruth Popper, the depressed middle-aged wife of his high school coach. Duane, Sonny and others take their young, mentally disabled friend, Billy, to a prostitute to lose his virginity. Returning him home, local businessman Sam \"The Lion\" is angered by their treatment of Billy, who habitually sweeps Anarene's main street. He forbids the group from entering any of his businesses, the only entertainment in town: the pool hall, movie theater, and café. Later, when Sam catches Sonny visiting Billy and Genevieve the waitress at the café, Sonny apologizes and Sam lifts the ban on him. Bobby makes an advance on Jacy, but refuses to have sex with her because she is a virgin. On New Year's Eve weekend, Duane and Sonny impulsively drive to Mexico.

Jacy invites Duane to a motel room for sex, as she wants to be accepted into Bobby's libertine circle. He is unable to get an erection, so she scolds him. Later, they try again and Duane performs briefly, just enough for Jacy to lose her virginity. She breaks up with him by phone, hoping to become involved with Bobby. However, Jacy learns that Bobby has already married another girl. Out of boredom and feeling rejected, she has sex with Abilene, her father Gene's roughneck foreman and her mother's lover.

    "plot": "In 1987, Jerry Lundegaard is the executive sales manager of a Minneapolis car dealership owned by his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson. Desperate for money, he plans to have his wife, Jean, kidnapped. On the recommendation of dealership mechanic and parolee Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets Gaear Grimsrud and Carl Showalter at a bar in Fargo, North Dakota . Gaear and Carl agree to kidnap Jean in exchange for a new Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera and half of the $80,000 ransom Jerry intends to extort from Wade. Believing he has secured a $750,000 loan from Wade for a lucrative real estate deal, Jerry unsuccessfully tries to call off the kidnapping. However, Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will handle the deal himself, offering Jerry only a modest finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in Moose Lake . A state trooper stops them near Brainerd for not displaying temporary registration tags . The trooper rejects Carl's clumsy bribe attempt and orders Carl out of the car. The trooper hears Jean whimpering in the back seat, so Gaear shoots the trooper dead, then kills two passersby who witnessed the scene. Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson, who is seven months pregnant, begins investigating. She correctly deduces that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealer plates . She later learns that two men driving a dealership vehicle checked into a nearby motel with two call girls and placed a call to Shep. Marge visits Wade's dealership, where Shep feigns ignorance and Jerry nervously insists no cars are missing. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita, a high school classmate. Mike awkwardly tries to romance her before breaking down and telling her his wife has died. Jerry tells Wade the kidnappers have demanded $1 million and will deal only through him. In light of the three murders, Carl demands that Jerry hand over the $80,000 he believes is the entire ransom. Shep finds Carl with a call girl in Shep's Minneapolis apartment and beats him in retaliation for bringing Shep to the police's attention. Carl angrily calls Jerry and demands that he bring the money immediately. Wade insists on delivering the ransom and meets Carl at a parking garage. Wade refuses to hand over the money without seeing his daughter, so Carl shoots him. Wade fires back, wounding Carl in the jaw. Carl kills Wade and a garage attendant, then drives away with the cash. On the way to Moose Lake, Carl discovers the briefcase contains $1 million. He takes out $80,000 to split with Gaear and buries the rest in the snow alongside the highway. Marge learns from a friend that Yanagita lied; he has no wife and is mentally ill. Reflecting on this, Marge returns to Wade's dealership. An agitated Jerry again insists no cars are missing and tells Marge he will double-check the inventory. Marge sees Jerry driving off the lot and calls the state police. At the cabin, Carl finds that Gaear killed Jean because she would not be quiet. Carl says they should split up and leave immediately, and they argue over who will keep the Ciera. Carl insults Gaear and attempts to leave with the car, but Gaear, having become annoyed with Carl's persistent talking, chases him outside and kills him with an axe. Marge drives to Moose Lake, tipped off by a local bartender who overheard a customer brag about killing someone. She sees the Ciera, then discovers Gaear feeding Carl's body into a woodchipper . Gaear attempts to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Shortly after, Jerry is arrested by state troopers at a motel outside Bismarck, North Dakota . Marge's husband, Norm, tells her the Postal Service has selected his painting of a mallard for a 3-cent postage stamp and complains that his friend's painting won the competition for a 29-cent stamp. Marge reminds him that smaller denomination stamps make up the difference between the face value of old stamps and the new cost of first-class postage. Norm is reassured, and the couple happily anticipates the birth of their child.",

When a child asks her why wickedness happens, Glinda relays the Witch's backstory - born from an affair between the wife of then-Governor Thropp, Melena, and a mysterious traveling salesman, the Witch was ostracized from birth due to her unnaturally green skin (a result of the green elixir the salesman intoxicated Melena with), and her telekinetic powers, which she inadvertently uses when she experiences any strong emotion (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). When asked if she and the Witch were friends, Glinda reveals that they knew each other from school. Years earlier, Elphaba Thropp arrives at Shiz University to see off her wheelchair-using  younger sister, Nessarose (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). After witnessing an accidental release of Elphaba's powers Shiz's Dean of Sorcery Studies Madame Morrible offers to enroll and privately tutor Elphaba in sorcery. Elphaba accepts, hoping that it will allow her to accomplish her dream of working with Oz's ruler, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz , and having him change her skin color (\" The Wizard and I \"). To the discontent of both, Elphaba is forced to room with the bubbly, popular Galinda Upland, with whom she clashes constantly (\"What Is This Feeling?\"). One night, Elphaba follows history professor Dr. Dillamond, an anthropomorphic Goat who faces discrimination as one of Shiz's last Animal professors, to a meeting of Animals off-campus. Dillamond reveals that other Animals are losing their ability to speak, but Elphaba assures him the Wizard will fix it (\"Something Bad\"). Rebellious transfer student Fiyero Tigelaar takes a group of students to a party at the Ozdust Ballroom nightclub (\"Dancing Through Life\"). Galinda convinces her admirer Boq Woodsman , a happy-go-lucky Munchkin , to invite Nessarose so she can accompany Fiyero. Moved by this, Elphaba convinces a begrudging Morrible to tutor Galinda. Elphaba arrives at the Ozdust and is ridiculed for wearing a pointed hat that Galinda gave her as a joke. Galinda remorsefully dances with her (\"Ozdust Duet\"), later repaying her kindness with a makeover (\" Popular \"). Dillamond announces that Animals are no longer allowed to teach at Shiz and is forcibly removed from his classroom. His replacement, the unscrupulous Professor Nikidik, demonstrates a new contraption - a cage containing a frightened lion cub , designed to prevent Animals from learning to speak. Enraged, Elphaba releases her powers and spins poppy dust over the room, rendering everyone except herself and Fiyero asleep. They escape campus and release the cub into the forest. After sharing a moment, Elphaba laments her unrequited feelings for Fiyero (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). The Wizard invites Elphaba to meet him, having learned of her powers from Morrible. Galinda, now calling herself \"Glinda\" in honor of Dillamond's mispronunciation of her name, accompanies her. They arrive in the Emerald City (\"One Short Day\") and are introduced to the Wizard, who is an ordinary man (\"A Sentimental Man\"). Morrible arrives to witness Elphaba and the Wizard's meeting. At their urging, Elphaba casts a levitation spell from the sacred Grimmerie spellbook that makes the Wizard's monkey guards painfully sprout wings . As the Wizard and Morrible rejoice over their newfound ability to use the monkeys as spies, Elphaba realizes that they are the ones behind the Animals' oppression and that the fraudulent Wizard, lacking any real magic of his own, used her to further subjugate them. Horrified, Elphaba steals the Grimmerie and flees. Glinda follows Elphaba and implores her to reconcile with Morrible and the Wizard, but Elphaba refuses. Glinda supports her, but declines to accompany her. The two share an emotional farewell before Glinda is apprehended by guards. Elphaba repeats the levitation spell on a broom and escapes the city. Morrible sends out warnings to the citizens of Oz, deeming Elphaba a \"wicked witch\" and demanding she be found and apprehended. Fiyero leaves Shiz on horseback amidst a mass evacuation while Governor Thropp suffers a heart attack after he and Nessarose receive the news.

    "name": "Fiddler on the Roof",
    "plot": "The film takes place in 1905 in the fictional small village of Anatevka somewhere in Ukraine , in the Russian Empire . The story centers on Tevye , a Jewish milkman and his family. Occasionally, Tevye breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience or to the heavens for the audience's benefit. Tevye is poor despite working hard, like most other Jews in Anatevka. He and his wife, Golde, have five daughters, and cannot afford a dowry to marry them off. Life in the shtetl of Anatevka is difficult, and Tevye speaks not only of the hardships of poverty but also of the Jewish community's constant fear of harassment from their non-Jewish neighbors. Tevye explains that the lot of the Jews in Russia is as precarious as a fiddler on a roof, trying to eke out a pleasant tune while not breaking their necks. What keeps them alive is the balance they achieve through obedience to their ancient traditions. The fiddler appears throughout the film as a metaphoric reminder of the Jews' ever-present fears and danger. While making his rounds, Tevye meets Perchick, a young man passing through Anatevka; Perchick is a student from the university in Kiev , with radical political ideas. Tevye invites Perchik to his home for the Sabbath meal with his family and offers him room and board in exchange for tutoring his daughters. Yente the matchmaker , has arranged for Tevye's eldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry widower Lazar Wolf, Anatevka's affluent butcher , who is many years older than she. However, Tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Motel the tailor. Tevye does not think very highly of Motel, considering him unambitious, timid and meek. When Tevye tells Tzeitel of the match, she begs her father not to force her to marry the butcher; she and Motel have given each other their pledge to be married. Tevye is incredulous, but he reluctantly gives Tzeitel and Motel permission to marry, in spite of the pact made with Lazar Wolf. Worried that Golde will not accept the marriage, Tevye tells her of a false prophetic dream he had in which Tzeitel is fated to marry Motel, and Lazar's dead wife will haunt her if she marries the butcher. Earlier, Tevye is warned by the Constable that the locals would attack (calling it an \"Unofficial Demonstration\"), on an indefinite date, and the milkman wonders why God would allow this to happen. At the wedding, an argument erupts among the guests over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy when he asks Tevye's daughter Hodel to dance with him, crossing the barrier between the men and women . Initially, the crowd is shocked but they soon warm to the idea and the wedding proceeds with great joy until a mob arrives and begin a pogrom , attacking the Jews and destroying their property. Perchik tries to intervene, but is subdued by the Czar's men with a candlestick holder, resulting in a concussion. While the attacks continue with the other Jewish villages, Tevye can only wonder why God could not stop the atrocities. Later, as Perchik prepares to return to Kiev to take part in the revolution , he tells Hodel that he loves her, and she agrees to marry him. Tevye is furious when they tell him of their intention to marry with or without his permission, but, as with Tzeitel and Motel, he eventually gives his blessing because they love each other. Weeks later, Perchik is arrested at a demonstration in Kiev and exiled to Siberia . Hodel leaves home to join him there, much to Tevye's sorrow. Meanwhile, Tevye's third daughter, Chava, has fallen in love with a young Christian man, Fyedka. She eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye to allow her to marry him. In a soliloquy, Tevye concludes that while he could accept his older daughters' choosing their own husbands, he cannot countenance Chava marrying a non-Jew, in effect abandoning the Jewish faith. He forbids her to associate with him. Chava and Fyedka elope and marry in a Russian Orthodox Church. Tevye rejects and disowns Chava when she tries to beg forgiveness and acceptance from him. Finally, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to vacate the village. Tevye and his family and friends pack and head variously for New York, Chicago, Jerusalem, and other places they know nothing about. Chava and Fyedka arrive to inform Tevye, who ignores the conversation, that the two of them are moving to Krakow, Poland. As they say their goodbyes Tevye mutters 'God be with you', which Tzeitel repeats to the couple. As Tevye pulls the wagon loaded with his family's possessions, he notices the fiddler behind him; the film ends with the fiddler following Tevye and his family down the road.",

    "name": "Milk",
    "plot": "The film opens with archival footage of police raiding gay bars and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by Dianne Feinstein 's November 27, 1978 announcement to the press that Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone had been assassinated . Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith . Dissatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley , a working-class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro . Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist , eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones . Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but he grows frustrated with Milk's devotion to politics and leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay \"establishment\", which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly , Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5, after a change from at-large elections to district elections. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and the third openly homosexual politician in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White , a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative , has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes. Milk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6 , an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by John Briggs , a conservative state senator from Orange County , Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by Anita Bryant and her organization Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal a local gay rights ordinance. On November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. A desperate White favors a supervisor pay raise but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk. On the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters City Hall through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution-style. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a closeted gay man. [ 3 ] The last scene is a candlelight vigil held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city. Pictures of the actual people depicted in the film, and brief summaries of their lives follow.",

    "obfuscated_plot": "A documentary-style film opens with archival footage of police raiding gay bars and arresting patrons during mid-20th century, followed by a female politician's press conference announcing the assassination of a gay city supervisor and the city's mayor. The protagonist is seen recording his will days before his murder. The film flashes back to a large northeastern city in 1970, where the protagonist, approaching middle age, meets his younger lover. Dissatisfied with their current life, they move to a western city seeking greater acceptance of their relationship. They open a photography business in a working-class neighborhood transitioning into a gay community. Frustrated by local opposition, the protagonist uses his business background to become a gay rights activist and mentors a younger activist. His first romantic relationship ends due to his political devotion. A subsequent relationship with a volatile young man also fails, ending in the partner's suicide. After multiple unsuccessful political campaigns, he wins a seat on the city's board of supervisors, becoming the first openly gay man elected to significant public office in the state. He develops a complex relationship with a conservative fellow supervisor, a former military and emergency services worker. Despite initial attempts at collaboration, their relationship deteriorates when the protagonist opposes the other supervisor's proposals. The protagonist leads a successful campaign against a state ballot initiative designed to ban gay teachers, which is part of a broader conservative movement against gay rights. After defeating the proposition, the protagonist continues his activism. The conservative supervisor, feeling increasingly marginalized, resigns and seeks reinstatement. When denied, he enters the city hall, murders the mayor, and then assassinates the protagonist in an execution-style killing. The film implies the murderer might have been struggling with his own sexuality. The narrative concludes with a massive citywide candlelight vigil honoring the victims."

    "plot": "In 1858 Texas, several male African American slaves are being \"driven\" by the Speck Brothers, Ace and Dicky. Among the shackled slaves is Django, sold off and separated from his wife, Broomhilda. The Speck Brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German ex-dentist and bounty hunter from Düsseldorf . Schultz asks to buy one of the slaves, but while questioning Django about his knowledge of the Brittle Brothers, for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant , he irritates Ace, who aims his shotgun at Schultz. Schultz quickly kills Ace and leaves Dicky at the mercy of the other newly freed slaves, who kill him. Since Django can identify the Brittle Brothers, Schultz offers Django his freedom in exchange for his help in tracking them down. Django discovers Schultz is a bounty hunter, as Schultz kills an outlaw named Willard Peck, who was posing as the Sheriff in a small town. Schultz and Django then track the Brittle Brothers down, leading them to a plantation . Django shoots dead the first brother, brutally whips the second before shooting him too, while Schultz kills the third brother. They then ambush and kill the plantation owner who leads a group of lynchers . Django partners with Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice, and Schultz discovers Django's natural ability with gunslinging . Schultz explains that, being the first person he has ever given freedom to, he feels responsible for Django and is driven to help him in his quest to rescue Broomhilda. Django, now fully trained, collects his first bounty , keeping the handbill as a good luck charm. In Mississippi , Schultz uncovers the identity of Broomhilda's owner: Calvin Candie, the charming but brutal owner of the Candyland Plantation, where black slaves are forced to fight in wrestling deathmatches called \" Mandingo fights\". Schultz, expecting Candie will not sell Broomhilda if they ask for her directly, plots to feign interest in purchasing one of Candie's prized fighters, offer to purchase Broomhilda on the side for a reasonable sum, then take her and escape before the Mandingo deal is finalized. Schultz and Django meet Candie at his gentleman's club in Greenville and submit their offer. His greed tickled, Candie invites them to Candyland. After secretly briefing Broomhilda on the plan, Schultz claims to be charmed by the German-speaking Broomhilda and offers to buy her after arranging to buy a fighting slave. During dinner, Candie's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious. Deducing that Django and Broomhilda know each other and that the sale of the Mandingo fighter is just a misdirection, Stephen alerts and privately admonishes Candie on his greed. Candie is humiliated at being fooled by a black man, but he contains his anger long enough to theatrically display his knowledge of phrenology which he uses to justify white superiority and black inferiority. Candie's bodyguard suddenly bursts into the room with his shotgun trained on the two bounty hunters, and Candie furiously threatening to kill Broomhilda. He extorts Schultz for the complete bid amount, and taunts him by demanding a formal handshake to finalize the deal before he leaves. Tired of his arrogance, Schultz fatally shoots Candie with a concealed derringer and his henchman kills him in turn. Django grabs a revolver and, after a violent shootout, is forced to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage at gunpoint. The next morning, Stephen tells Django that he will be sold to a mine where he will labor for the rest of his life. En route to the mine, Django proves to his dim-witted Australian escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them the handbill from his first kill. He convinces them that there is a large bounty for outlaws who are hiding at Candyland, and promises that they would receive most of the money. The escorts release him and give him a pistol, and he kills them before stealing a horse and leaving for Candyland. Django returns to the plantation and kills more of Candie's henchmen. He takes Broomhilda's freedom papers from Schultz's pocket and frees her from a nearby cabin. When Candie's mourners return from his burial, Django kills Candie's few remaining henchmen and his sister Lara, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen. Django then ignites dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. He and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing the disabled Stephen, before riding off together.",

    "plot": "In the mid-1800s, [ 8 ] Ada McGrath, a Scottish woman with elective mutism , travels to colonial New Zealand with her daughter Flora for an arranged marriage to settler Alisdair Stewart. Ada has not spoken since the age of six, and the reason for this as well as the identity of Flora's father remain unknown. She communicates through playing the piano and sign language, with Flora acting as her interpreter. Ada and Flora, along with their handcrafted piano, are stranded on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The next day, Alisdair arrives with his Māori crew and neighbour George Baines, a retired sailor who's adapted to Maori customs, including facial tattoos . Alisdair tells Ada that they don't have enough bearers for the piano and then refuses to go back for it, claiming that they all need to make sacrifices. Desperate to retrieve her piano, Ada seeks George's help. While at first saying no, he appears to give in due to her keenness on recovering the piano. Once at the beach, he is entranced by her music and appears charmed by her happy ways when she is playing, in contrast to her stern behaviour when in the farm. George offers Alisdair the land he's been coveting in exchange for the piano and Ada's lessons. Alisdair agrees, oblivious to George's attraction to Ada. Ada is enraged by George's proposition but agrees to trade lessons for piano keys. She restricts the lessons to the black keys only and resists George's demands for more intimacy. Ada continues to rebuff Alisdair's advances while exploring her sensuality with George. George eventually realizes that Ada will never commit to him emotionally and returns the piano to her, confessing that he wants Ada to care for him genuinely. Although Ada has her piano back, she longs for George and returns to him. Alisdair overhears them having sex and watches them through a crack in the wall. Furious, he confronts Ada and tries to force himself on her despite her strong resistance. He then coerces Ada into promising she will no longer see George. Shortly after, Ada instructs Flora to deliver a package to George, which contains a piano key with a love declaration engraved on it. Flora delivers it to Alisdair instead. Enraged after reading the message, Alisdair cuts off Ada's index finger, depriving her of the ability to play the piano. He sends Flora to George with the severed finger, warning him to stay away from Ada or he will chop off more fingers. Later, while touching Ada as she sleeps, Alisdair hears what he thinks is her voice in his head, asking him to let George take her away. He goes to George's house and asks if Ada has ever spoken to him, but George says no. George and Ada leave together with her belongings and piano tied onto a Māori canoe . As they row to the ship, Ada asks George to throw the piano overboard. She allows her leg to be caught by the rope attached to the piano and is dragged underwater with it in an attempt to drown herself. As she sinks, she appears to change her mind and struggles free before being pulled to safety. In the epilogue , Ada describes her new life with George and Flora in Nelson , where she gives piano lessons in their new home. George has made her a metal finger to replace the one she lost, and Ada has been practicing and taking speech lessons.

Less than four months later, Diana, Princess of Wales is killed in a car crash at the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris. Immediately, her death presents problems for her former husband, Prince Charles , and the Prime Minister , Tony Blair , what to accord the mother of a future king who is no longer a member of the royal family. Queen Elizabeth II wonders if Blair will turn his modernisation pledge on to the royal family since he attempts to have her reconsider her views on the funeral plans. Diana's family, the Spencers , calls for the funeral to be private. Following a speech in which Blair describes Diana as the \"People's Princess\" and the adoption of the title by the press, an outpouring of grief by the general public begins in broadcasts and displays of floral tributes so numerous at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the main entrances onto the complexes have to be rerouted. The royal family's senior members make no effort to acknowledge Diana's significance to society as the Queen feels that she must comfort and shield her grandsons following the death of their mother, and so remains on holiday at Balmoral . The royal family's popularity plummets, while Blair's approval rises as he responds to the public outcry of the royal family's inaction. Blair's attempts to guide the royal family through the controversy are met with resistance: the Queen describes them as a surrender to public hysteria. Despite the Queen and Prince Philip's indignation toward any sympathy toward Diana or acknowledgment of the country's mourning, Blair is encouraged by the private secretaries of both the Prince of Wales and the Queen to continue with his attempts to change the attitude of the royal family. As Britain continues its outpouring of grief, Blair attempts to defend the royal family publicly, but his attempts are futile. Blair's compassion earns him overwhelming praise and adoration, while the royal family's seeming indifference earns them fiery condemnation from the people. As Britain's outrage hits a critical mass, Blair cannot continue to finesse the Queen's refusal to acknowledge Diana and the public. He reveals to her that 70% of the country believes her actions are damaging to the monarchy, and \"1 in 4\" people are in favour of abolishing the monarchy altogether. Blair adamantly insists that the royal family fly the flag at Buckingham Palace at half-mast, that the Queen pay her respects to Diana and give a public address consoling the country. Although she is demoralised by the country's reaction and the Prime Minister's suggestions, the Queen comes to realise that the world has changed during her reign. She and Prince Philip return to London despite their disagreement. The Queen finally pays public tribute on live television to Diana's significance to the nation and society and can somewhat quell Britain's agony. The royal family attends the public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey . At Blair's next meeting with the Queen, they exchange views about what has happened since their last meeting, including the controversy surrounding Diana's death and the actions that followed. Then she cautions the prime minister that, just as public opinion has changed about how the royal family should react to a new Britain, so must he as he may very well find himself in the same position of changing public opinion.",

The evening's main attraction is Queens resident Herb Stempel , the reigning champion, who correctly answers every single question he is asked. Eventually, both the network and the program's corporate sponsor, the supplementary tonic Geritol , begin to fear that Stempel's approval ratings are beginning to level out, and decide that the show would benefit from new talent. Producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman are surprised when Columbia University instructor Charles Van Doren , son of a prominent literary family, visits their office to audition for a different, less difficult show by the same producers, Tic-Tac-Dough . Realizing that they have found an ideal challenger for Stempel, they offer to ask the same questions during the show which Van Doren correctly answered during his audition. He refuses, but when he nears a game-winning 21 points on the show, he is asked one of the questions from his audition. After a moment of moral indecision, he gives the correct answer. Stempel deliberately misses an easy question and loses, having been promised a future in television if he does so. In the subsequent weeks, Van Doren's winning streak makes him a national celebrity, but he reluctantly buckles under the pressure and allows Enright and Freedman to start giving him the answers. Meanwhile, Stempel, having lost his prize money to an unscrupulous bookie , begins threatening legal action against NBC after weeks pass without his return to television. He visits New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan , who convenes a grand jury to look into his allegations. Richard Goodwin , a young Congressional lawyer, learns that the grand jury findings have been sealed and travels to New York City to investigate rumors of rigged quiz shows. Visiting a number of contestants, including Stempel and Van Doren, he begins to suspect that Twenty-One is a fixed operation. Stempel's volatile personality damages his credibility, and nobody else seems willing to confirm that the show is fixed. Fearing Goodwin will give up the investigation, Stempel confesses that he was fed the correct answers during his run on the show, and insists that Van Doren must have been involved as well. Another former contestant gives Goodwin a set of answers that he mailed to himself two days before his quiz show appearance, which Goodwin takes to be corroborating evidence.

    "plot": "In 1944 during World War II , Vernon Waters, a master sergeant in a company of Black soldiers, is shot to death with a .45 caliber pistol outside Fort Neal, a segregated Army base in Louisiana . Captain Richard Davenport, a Black officer from the Judge Advocate General's Corps , is sent to investigate. Most assume Waters was killed by the local Ku Klux Klan , but others are doubtful. Even Captain Taylor, the only White officer who wants the killers prosecuted, is uncooperative and patronizing, fearing a Black officer will have little success. Davenport soon discovers that whenever the Klan murders Black soldiers, they strip them of their military insignia, whereas the body of Sgt. Waters was found wearing an intact uniform. Davenport learns that Waters's company was officially part of the 221st Chemical Smoke Generator Battalion. They are kept on the Home Front and assigned menial jobs. Most are former baseball players from the Negro leagues , grouped to play ball with Waters as manager. Private James Wilkie, a former sergeant Waters busted for being drunk on duty, describes Waters as a combat veteran who was awarded with the Croix de Guerre by the Third French Republic during the First World War . He also says that Waters was a strict disciplinarian but a fair non-commissioned officer (NCO) who interacted well with his men, especially baseball pitcher and jazz musician C.J. Memphis. Private Peterson reveals Waters's tyrannical nature and his disgust with Black soldiers from the rural South who lacked education or who spoke in Gullah language . Peterson recalls how he thrashed Waters when the sergeant berated the men after a winning game. Interviewing other soldiers, Davenport learns that Waters charged Memphis with the murder of a White MP after a search conducted by Wilkie turned up a recently discharged pistol under his bunk. Waters provoked Memphis into hitting him, and while the murder charge was dismissed, Memphis was charged with striking a superior officer. Davenport interrogates Memphis's best friend, Corporal Bernard Cobb. Cobb recalls visiting Memphis in the brig , where he told Cobb of a visit in which Waters admitted the planted gun was part of a frame-up . Waters viewed \" Geechees \", as he termed uneducated southern Blacks like Memphis, as an obstacle to racial equality and the success of the future African American upper class . Davenport also learns from Cobb that Memphis, who suffered from claustrophobia , hanged himself while awaiting his court-martial . In protest, the baseball team threw the season's last game. Taylor disbanded the team, and the players were reassigned to the 221st. Davenport learns that racist White officers Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant Byrd had an altercation with Waters shortly before his death. While being interrogated by Davenport and Taylor at the officer's club, Wilcox and Byrd admit to assaulting a guilt-ridden Waters after he confronted them in a drunken tirade. They admit that they would have killed him, but only men on guard duty are issued .45 ammunition when the unit is on bivouac . Immediately after learning of Waters's murder, both officers turned in their sidearms , and ballistics testing cleared them. Davenport interrogates Wilkie, who admits he planted the gun under Memphis's bunk on Waters's orders. Wilkie also reveals that Waters had told him the real reasons for his hatred of Gullah-speaking southern Blacks like Memphis. While serving with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in France during World War I , a Black soldier in Waters's unit had, at the urging of racist White doughboys , humiliated them all by dressing up and acting like a monkey in front of French women at a cabaret . In retaliation, Waters and his enraged fellow Black doughboys slit the soldier's throat. Davenport demands to know why Waters did not also frame Peterson after their fight. Wilkie explains that Waters liked Peterson, as he spoke proper English and stood up for himself. Davenport has Wilkie arrested just as the 221st is about to be shipped out to join the fight overseas. Realizing Peterson and Smalls were on guard duty the night of the murder and thus had been issued .45 ammunition, Davenport interrogates Smalls. He confesses to watching as Peterson fatally shot Waters, claiming it was \"justice\" for Memphis and for all Black people. Taylor congratulates Davenport on the arrests of Wilkie, Peterson, and Smalls, admitting that he will have to become accustomed to Negroes being commissioned officers . Meanwhile, the platoon marches in preparation for their deployment to the European theater of war.",

    "obfuscated_plot": "During a wartime period, a master sergeant in a segregated military unit is shot to death outside a military base. A Black officer from the legal corps is sent to investigate the murder. While most assume a local racist hate group is responsible, the investigating officer discovers inconsistencies in the initial theories.\n\nThe victim was a strict military leader who managed a company of soldiers, many of whom were former athletes. He was known for his harsh treatment of soldiers from rural backgrounds, believing they hindered racial progress. The sergeant had previously framed a talented musician soldier for a crime, leading to that soldier's suicide.\n\nThrough interviews with fellow soldiers, the investigator uncovers a complex history of racial tensions within the unit. The victim's past included a traumatic incident during an earlier war, where he and fellow soldiers violently punished a Black soldier who had been humiliated by racist white soldiers.\n\nThe investigation reveals that the murder was an act of revenge. Two soldiers, motivated by the earlier framing and suicide of their friend, conspired to kill the sergeant. One soldier actually committed the shooting, viewing it as justice for past wrongs.\n\nThe investigating officer successfully identifies the murderers and arrests them just before the unit is deployed to an overseas combat zone. The white commanding officer reluctantly acknowledges the Black investigator's competence, reflecting the era's racial dynamics."

    "plot": "By 1950, the 44-year-old Puyi , former Emperor of China, has been in custody for five years since his capture by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria . In the recently established People's Republic of China , Puyi arrives as a political prisoner and war criminal at the Fushun Prison . Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial. 42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the Forbidden City by the dying Empress Dowager Cixi . After telling him that the previous emperor had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace eunuchs and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his wet nurse , Ar Mo . As he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, Pujie , who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a republic ; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, Reginald Johnston is appointed as Puyi's tutor and gives him a Western-style education , and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers ' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds Wanrong , with Wenxiu as a secondary consort. Puyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to Tientsin following the Beijing Coup . He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile , and sides with Japan after the Mukden Incident . During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to opium addiction . In 1934, the Japanese crown him \"Emperor\" of their puppet state of Manchukuo , though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to an illegitimate child, but the baby is murdered at birth by the Japanese and proclaimed stillborn . She is then taken to a clinic where her physical and mental state declines even further. Puyi remains the nominal ruler of the region until Japan's capitulation. He decides to surrender to the Americans but before he can leave, he is captured by the Soviet Red Army and handed over to the Chinese. Under the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War . After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese , Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959. Several years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence following the rise of Mao Zedong's cult of personality and the Cultural Revolution . On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, celebrating the rejection of landlordism by the communists. He sees Jin Yuan, now one of the political prisoners punished as an anti-revolutionary in the parade, forced to wear a dunce cap and a sandwich board bearing punitive slogans. Puyi later visits the Forbidden City, now turned into a museum, where he meets an assertive young boy wearing the red scarf of the Pioneer Movement . The boy orders Puyi to step away from the throne, but Puyi proves that he was indeed the Son of Heaven before approaching the throne. Behind it, Puyi finds a 60-year-old pet cricket that he was given by palace official Chen Baochen on his coronation day and gives it to the child. Amazed by the gift, the boy turns to talk to Puyi, but finds that he has disappeared. In 1987, a tour guide leads a group through the palace. Stopping in front of the throne, the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, before concluding that he died in 1967.",

After Hampton is imprisoned for allegedly stealing $71 worth of ice cream bars, O'Neal begins to rise through the ranks and is promoted to security captain. When a shootout between the Chicago Police and the BPP occurs at the chapter office, O'Neal sneaks out as the police firebomb the office. Outraged that he could have been killed, O'Neal attempts to quit being an informant, but Mitchell refuses, threatening him with the original charges. Three months later, Hampton is released from prison while appealing his charges and reunites with Deborah, now pregnant with his child.

After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills , promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment. During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play \" I Ran \" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and – despite an obvious chemistry – lament wasting a lovely night on each other. Seb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot , where she works as a barista , while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club , describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening of Rebel Without a Cause and she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to the Griffith Observatory . After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write a one-woman play . Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform. During the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada . Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go. During the audition the next day, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism , inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship. Five years later, Mia is living a happy life as a successful actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano.

    "plot": "In 1966, U.S. State Department analyst Daniel Ellsberg is sent to Vietnam, where he embeds with American soldiers and documents the on-the-ground reality of the Vietnam War . He soon realizes that the war is hopeless, and, when he returns to the U.S. to deliver his report, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara agrees. However, Ellsberg is left disillusioned when McNamara continues to publicly justify further deployments of American troops. After his mission ends, Ellsberg works for the RAND Corporation , a think-tank with access to classified information. Over the following years he secretly copies thousands of classified pages documenting long-term U.S. interference in Vietnam , dating back to the Truman administration ; once he finishes copying the full collection, he leaks it to journalist Neil Sheehan at The New York Times . In 1971, Katharine Graham has been the owner and publisher of provincial newspaper The Washington Post for eight years since the suicide of her husband Phil Graham , the former publisher, and the death of her father Eugene Meyer , the former owner. Although she lacks journalistic and business experience, she hopes to take the company public and secure investment for higher-quality news of national importance. She personally appoints the bullish Ben Bradlee as the Post 's executive editor as he agrees with her vision, but her male-dominated board still view her as a housewife in over her head. She is also still a prominent D.C. socialite, and Bradlee has to repeatedly assert his editorial independence whenever the paper runs a story critical of her friends. McNamara, one of these friends, tells Graham that an \"unflattering\" story about him will be published in The New York Times —the first of Sheehan's scoops from Ellsberg's documents. As the Post 's editors discuss how they might pursue the story further, an anonymous woman leaves one hundred pages of the leaked documents on a reporter's desk. Bradlee is delighted at the chance to get ahead of the Times on a major story in the Post 's own backyard, but a federal district court issues its injunction against the Times . Graham—concerned about both the Post 's liability and her own social standing—orders Bradlee to respect the injunction. Post assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down Ellsberg, a former colleague at RAND, as the source. Ellsberg gives him the full 4,000-page report and Post reporters dig through the pages, but their attorneys advise against publishing lest the Nixon administration file criminal charges. Agonizing over whether to publish, Graham confers with McNamara and her disapproving board. They warn that she will face social exile in D.C., retaliation from President Nixon , and loss of investors. However, Bradlee argues that they have a strong public interest defense, and it could transform the Post into the important journalistic institution that Graham had been dreaming of. The documents also revealed that his own circle of elite D.C. friends, including John F. Kennedy , lied to him to garner sympathetic coverage; he argues that Graham's own friendships with figures like McNamara should not influence her decision. Graham gives the go-ahead to print. However, Bagdikian then reveals he used the same source as Sheehan instead of independently verifying the documents. The Post 's lawyers panic—it puts Graham and Bradlee in contempt of court under the original injunction, and opens them to further criminal liability under the Espionage Act . The Post and Times appear before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment rights. In solidarity, other newspapers across the U.S. publish information from Ellsberg's documents. On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor , vindicating Graham's decision. In response, Nixon bars the Post from ever entering the White House again. One year later, Watergate complex security guard Frank Wills discovers a burglary-in-progress and calls the police, inadvertently kicking off the Watergate scandal .",

Inez grows jaded with Paris and Gil's continual disappearances, while her father grows suspicious and hires a private detective to follow him. Gil continues to time-travel the following nights.  Adriana leaves Picasso and continues to bond with Gil, who is conflicted by his attraction to her. Gil explains his situation to Salvador Dalí , Man Ray , and Luis Buñuel ; as surrealists , they do not question his claim of coming from the future. Gil later suggests the plot of \" The Exterminating Angel \" to Buñuel. Back in the present, Gil meets Gabrielle, an antique dealer and fellow admirer of the Lost Generation . Later at a book stall he finds Adriana's diary, which reveals that she had been in love with Gil and dreamed of being gifted earrings before making love to him. Planning to seduce Adriana, Gil plans to take a pair of Inez's earrings but is thwarted by her early return to the hotel room.

Later, a horse-drawn carriage appears and transports them to the Belle Époque , an era Adriana considers Paris's Golden Age . They go to the Moulin Rouge where they meet Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , Paul Gauguin , and Edgar Degas , who all agree that Paris's best era was the Renaissance . Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes; thrilled, she proposes to Gil that they stay. But he, observing the unhappiness of Adriana and the other artists, realizes that chasing nostalgia is fruitless because the present is always \"a little unsatisfying.\" Adriana decides to stay, and they part ways. Meanwhile, the detective following Gil takes a \"wrong turn\" and ends up being chased by the palace guards of Louis XVI just before a revolution breaks out. Gil rewrites the first two chapters of his novel and gives his draft to Stein, who praises his rewrite. Still, Hemingway says that on reading the new chapters he does not believe that the protagonist does not realize that his fiancée (based on Inez) is having an affair with the character based on Paul. Gil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez, who admits to sleeping with Paul but regarded it as a meaningless fling. Gil breaks up with her and decides to stay in Paris. While walking by the Seine at midnight, no carriage comes by but Gil encounters Gabrielle. As it begins to rain, he offers to walk her home and learns that they share a love for Paris in the rain.",

    "plot": "The film opens with a portion of the famous introduction to the novel: “ It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us... In short, it was a period very like the present...” Lucie Manette ( Elizabeth Allan ) and her servant and companion Miss Pross ( Edna May Oliver ) are informed by elderly banker Mr. Jarvis Lorry ( Claude Gillingwater ) that her father, Dr. Alexandre Mannette ( Henry B. Walthall ) is not dead, but has been a prisoner in the Bastille for eighteen years before finally being rescued. She travels with Mr. Lorry to Paris to take her father to her home in England. Dr. Manette has been cared for by a former servant, Ernest De Farge ( Mitchell Lewis ), and his wife ( Blanche Yurka ) who own a wine shop in Paris. The old man's mind has given way during his long ordeal, but Lucie's tender care begins to restore his sanity. On the return trip across the English Channel , Lucie meets Charles Darnay ( Donald Woods ), a French aristocrat who, unlike his uncle, the Marquis St. Evremonde ( Basil Rathbone ), is sympathetic to the plight of the oppressed and impoverished French masses. He has denounced his uncle, relinquished his title, changed his name and is going to England to begin a new life. The marquis has Darnay framed for treason, but he is defended by barrister C.J. Stryver ( Reginald Owen ) and his highly proficient but cynical colleague Sydney Carton ( Ronald Colman ). Carton goes drinking with Barsad ( Walter Catlett ), the main prosecution witness and tricks him into admitting that he framed Darnay. When Barsad is called to testify, he is horrified to discover that Carton is a member of the defense. He recants his testimony to save himself, and Darnay is acquitted. Following the trial, Carton is thanked by Lucie. He quickly falls in love with her. Darnay confesses to Dr. Manette he is the nephew of the Marquis St. Evremonde; Manette forgives him, but reserves the right to tell Lucie himself. On their way to church, Lucie meets Carton and invites him to join them and he accepts. Afterwards, she invites him into their home to celebrate Christmas, but he declines because he has been drinking. Lucie and Carton eventually become close friends. Carton has hopes that Lucie will requite his love, but one day she tells him that she is engaged to Darnay. Lucie and Darnay marry and have a daughter, also named Lucie, who is very fond of Carton. By this time, the French Revolution is beginning. Charles' uncle, the Marquis St. Evremond is one of its first victims, stabbed in his sleep by a man whose child had been fatally run down by his coach. The long-suffering peasants vent their fury on the aristocrats, condemning scores daily to Madame Guillotine . Darnay is tricked into returning to Paris and is arrested. Lucie and Dr. Manette travel to Paris to save Darnay. Manette pleads for mercy for his son-in-law, but Madame De Farge, seeking revenge against all the Evremondes, convinces the tribunal to sentence Darnay to death, using a letter Dr. Manette wrote while in prison, cursing and denouncing the entire Evremonde family. Upon learning of Darnay's imprisonment, Carton travels to Paris to comfort Lucie. Carton consults Mr. Lorry and tells him of his plan to rescue Darnay. Carton discovers Barsad is also in Paris and works as a spy in the prisons. Carton overcomes Barsad's reluctance to help him with his scheme to rescue Darnay by threatening to reveal that Barsad had been a spy for the Marquis St. Evremonde. Barsad takes Carton to visit Darnay in his cell; Carton renders Darnay unconscious with ether, switches clothes with him, and finishes the letter Darnay has been writing to Lucie and puts it in Darnay's pocket. Darnay is carried out of the cell without anyone noticing the switch. While Lucie prepares to return to England, Madame De Farge goes to provoke her into denouncing the Republic, but she is intercepted by Miss Pross inside the now-vacated apartment. Pross knows why Madame De Farge has come and is determined to stop her. The two women fight and De Farge pulls out a pistol, but in the ensuing struggle, Pross kills her. Darnay, Lucie, little Lucie, Lorry, and Pross all escape safely. While awaiting execution, a condemned, innocent seamstress ( Isabel Jewell ) who was sentenced at the same time as Darnay, notices Carton has assumed his identity. She draws comfort from his bravery and sacrifice as they ride together to the guillotine. As Carton stands at the foot of the guillotine, drums roll and then fade away as the camera rises up past the guillotine to the city and the sky above. His voice is heard saying, \"It's a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done. It's a far, far better rest I go to than I have ever known.\"",

Anne's beloved husband Tim Hilton has volunteered for U.S. Army service in World War II . Anne has just returned from seeing her husband off to Camp Claiborne , and she and her daughters must adjust to Tim's absence and make other sacrifices for the war effort, including food rationing; planting a victory garden ; giving up the services of their loyal maid Fidelia who nevertheless offers to continue working part-time for the Hiltons while foregoing wages; and taking in a boarder, the curmudgeonly retired Colonel William Smollett. When the Hiltons travel by train in a failed attempt to see Tim one last time before he ships out, they encounter or travel with many other people whose lives have been affected by the war, and they end up not getting to see Tim because their train is delayed to allow a defense supply train to go through first. In contrast, the Hiltons' socialite neighbor Emily Hawkins complains about the inconveniences caused by the war and engages in unsupportive behaviors such as hoarding food and criticizing the Hiltons' efforts. The Colonel has a strained relationship with his young grandson, Bill Smollett, because Bill \"was kicked out\" of West Point and is now serving in the U.S. Army as a mere corporal rather than an officer. An old friend of Anne and Tim's, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Tony Willett, also visits the Hiltons while awaiting his orders. Bill quickly falls for Jane, who has a crush on Tony, who in turn has long been attracted to Anne. However, after Tony leaves, Bill and Jane's relationship slowly develops and they fall in love. They become engaged, but Bill convinces Jane to wait until after the war to get married. Bill finally is sent overseas and Jane tearfully runs after his departing train to tell him goodbye. The Colonel, who under his gruff exterior really does care about his grandson, conveys his good wishes to Bill via Anne, but arrives too late to say goodbye in person. Jane is determined to do more for the war effort and begins volunteering as a nurses' aide at the nearby military hospital, where returning veterans with physical and mental injuries are sent to recover. The family learns via telegram that Tim Hilton is missing in action in the Southwest Pacific. Shortly after Bill's departure, the Hiltons receive word that he was killed in action at Salerno . The Hiltons and the Colonel grieve together for Bill. Jane and Anne finally tell off Emily after she suggests that it is unseemly for Jane to volunteer at the hospital, and Anne decides she herself must do more to help and trains as a welder for defense work at the shipyard. Tony returns on leave and talks to Anne about his feelings for her, but she believes that he only keeps her as a romantic ideal because she is married to his friend Tim and therefore unattainable. Anne and Tony decide to leave things as they are and remain friends. On Christmas Eve, Fidelia places gifts under the tree that Tim had given her months earlier to leave for his family, and Anne is moved to tears. Anne then gets a cablegram by telephone informing her that Tim is safe and is coming home, and she and her daughters joyfully embrace. \"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord.\"",

His friend's father, on whose couch Michael has been sleeping, asks Burt Cotton, the football coach of Wingate Christian School, to help get his son and Michael enrolled. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Michael is befriended by a younger student named Sean Tuohy Jr. (\"SJ\"). SJ's mother, Leigh Anne, is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Sr. The school staff tells Michael that his father has died, apparently due to an accident. Later, Leigh Anne and Sean watch their daughter Collins playing volleyball. After the game, Sean notices Michael picking up food discarded on the bleachers. On the eve of Thanksgiving, Leigh Anne notices Michael walking alone on the road, shivering in the cold without adequate clothing. When she learns that he plans to spend the night huddled outside the closed school gym, Leigh Anne offers to let him sleep on the couch in the Tuohy home. The next morning, Leigh Anne notices that Michael has left. Seeing him walking away, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Later, Leigh Anne drives Michael to his biological mother's house. He sees an eviction notice posted on the door, indicating that his mother is gone. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the Tuohy family; Leigh Anne's friends question this and suggest that Collins might not be safe around him, but Leigh Anne criticizes them. She later asks Collins how she feels about it. Collins replies that they cannot just throw Michael out. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was taken from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that, although he scored poorly in a career aptitude test, he ranked in the 98th percentile in \"protective instincts\". Michael eventually improves his grades enough that he can play football at school. However, Michael appears to be hesitant to use his strength and size while practicing, Leigh Anne tells him, as an offensive lineman, he must protect his quarterback. From that moment, Michael improves dramatically, well enough to play at the college level. However, to do that, he must meet the minimum grade point average to get in so the Tuohys hire a private tutor for him, the outspoken and kind Miss Sue. Leigh Anne has a face-to-face conversation with Michael's mother Denise about adopting him. Although she seems unresponsive in the beginning, Denise finally wishes Michael the best. Michael is heavily recruited by many prestigious schools. SJ talks to coaches and negotiates on both Michael's behalf and his own. When Michael gets his grades high enough, he decides to attend the University of Mississippi (known colloquially as \"Ole Miss\"). But as Ole Miss was where Sean Sr. had played basketball, Leigh Anne had been a cheerleader, and Miss Sue had been as well, NCAA investigator Granger is tasked to look into the matter to determine if the Tuohys took him in and unduly influenced him just so he would play for their alma mater . Michael runs away before the interview is over and confronts Leigh Anne about her motives for taking him in. He then proceeds to find his biological mother Denise in Hurt Village. A gang leader welcomes him back, offers him a beer, and makes sexually offensive insinuations about Leigh Anne and Collins. When Michael gets angry, the gang leader threatens to go after them, and as a result, Michael battles with him and others. After thinking things over and questioning Leigh Anne, Michael tells Granger he chose Ole Miss because \"it's where my family goes to school\".

    "plot": "Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston is a self-taught math genius who was recently paroled after completing a prison term. He works as a janitor at MIT , and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult graph theory mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. He later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate from Harvard , who plans on attending medical school at Stanford . Meanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer's details. Will and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at Bunker Hill Community College . Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up. Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the 1975 World Series after falling in love at first sight. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to \"see about a girl\", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death. Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the NSA with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something “greater”. Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will's potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that the abuse he received was not his fault by repeatedly stating, \"It's not your fault\", causing him to break down in tears in Sean's arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical. Will's friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he instead chose to reunite with Skylar, much to Sean's approval.",

    "plot": "While transcribing the conversation of passers-by one evening, linguist Professor Higgins is mistaken for a policeman, causing  protests from the Covent Garden flower seller Eliza Doolittle and various bystanders. As the incident is being cleared up, Higgins talks to Colonel Pickering, a fellow scholar of languages and dialects, who has come from India in order to meet him. Higgins argues that by teaching Eliza to speak correctly by his methods, she could have a better future and would even be able to pass as a duchess. Next morning, Eliza arrives at Higgins' house to ask for elocution lessons. Colonel Pickering makes a bet with him, offering to pay all the expenses if the professor manages to fulfill his boast. Eliza is then taken upstairs to have a bath by Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, and while this is taking place, Eliza's father, the dustman Alfred Doolittle, arrives to demand compensation for the loss of his daughter. Amused by Doolittle's roguish attitude, Higgins offers him £10, but Doolittle will only accept £5, explaining that as one of the \"undeserving poor\" he only wants enough for a drunken weekend. After a rigorous internship, Eliza is sent as an experiment to an at-home gathering held by Mrs Higgins, the professor's mother. There, though speaking in a well-bred accent, Eliza scandalizes those present with her vulgar, slang-filled conversation and profanity. But one of the guests - young Freddy Eynsford-Hill - is fascinated by her. After the guests leave, Mrs Higgins voices her disgust that Eliza's two protectors are treating her more like a plaything than a human being. Following weeks of further coaching, during which Freddy tries in vain to see her again, Eliza is accompanied by Higgins and Pickering to an embassy reception. There Higgins meets his former pupil, the Hungarian Count Aristid Karpathy, who has become famous for his ability to coach American heiresses in elocution and identify the origins of high society people from their way of speaking. Higgins and Pickering fear that Eliza will be exposed by him, but she manages to deceive him so successfully that he takes her for a Hungarian princess - explaining that her English is too perfect to be that of a native speaker. Returning from the reception, Higgins and Pickering congratulate each other on their success, neglecting Eliza's contribution and commitment and especially her feelings. Wounded by his indifference, Eliza quarrels with the professor, throwing his slippers in his face when he asks for them, and complains that she has become unsuited to her former way of life. After he goes to bed, she leaves to take refuge at the home of Mrs Higgins. Next morning Higgins visits his mother and is relieved to learn that Eliza is there. Before the two can meet, however, Mr Doolittle arrives to complain of the way Higgins has disrupted his life. The professor had jested to an American millionaire that the most original moralist in England was Doolittle, and when the millionaire died he had left Doolittle a bequest of £3000 annually to give six lectures a year, thus forcing respectability on the dustman. He is now on his way to a fashionable London church to marry his unwed partner and persuades Eliza, Pickering and Mrs Higgins to support him through the ordeal. Higgins and Eliza are left alone for a while and he tries to persuade her to return home with him, but she objects that he simply takes her for granted. Instead she would prefer to marry Freddy, who is charming but has no income. When Higgins scoffs at this, Eliza horrifies him by threatening to use her newly-learned talents to give elocution lessons and so gain economic independence. Once the party leaves to attend the wedding, an upset Higgins returns home after a long walk and accidentally turns on a recording of Eliza's first visit. As he listens, he is surprised to hear the real Eliza at the door to his study, mockingly quoting her former self by announcing, \"I washed my face and hands before I come, I did\".

During the First World War , Lawrence is a misfit lieutenant in the British Army , notable for his effrontery and education. Mr. Dryden of the Arab Bureau sends him to meet with Colonel Harry Brighton, who advises Prince Feisal in his revolt against the Turks . Lawrence is outraged when his guide is killed by Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish for drinking from the latter's well. Lawrence accuses Ali of being a barbarian and is dismayed to learn that the latter is Feisal's advisor. Relations between the United Kingdom and the Arabs are tense. While Britain will supply guns to the Arabs, it will not provide artillery , which would make Feisal an independent force. Brighton asks Feisal to fall back and help the British defend the Suez Canal . Lawrence violates Brighton's orders by encouraging Feisal to attack. Feisal is impressed by Lawrence's familiarity with the Quran and his honesty about British interests in Arabia . Lawrence convinces Feisal to launch a surprise attack on the port of Aqaba to improve his supply lines. Ali protests, as Aqaba is protected from land attacks by the harsh Nefud Desert and the local Turkish enforcer, Howeitat tribal leader Auda Abu Tayi . Feisal gives Lawrence just fifty men. Lawrence hires teenage orphans Daud and Farraj as his attendants. During the march to Aqaba, Lawrence wins over Feisal's men by turning back into the desert to rescue Gasim. The grateful Arabs give Lawrence traditional clothing. Lawrence convinces Auda to switch sides by promising him a Turkish gold hoard at Aqaba. Lawrence is shaken when he must execute Gasim to prevent a conflict. Lawrence and Auda capture Aqaba, but there is no gold. To placate Auda, Lawrence agrees to ask his superiors in Cairo for more money. Daud is drowned by quicksand along the way. In Cairo, Lawrence perplexes the British officers with his Arab clothes and his insistence that Farraj be treated with the same respect as a British officer. General Edmund Allenby promotes him to major and agrees to back the Arabs with arms and money. Before returning to his desert forces, Lawrence asks Allenby whether the Arabs are correct that the British seek to dominate Arabia and demands artillery for Feisal's army. Allenby lies to him on both counts. Lawrence launches a guerrilla war against the Turks. The American media romanticise Lawrence's exploits and make him famous, as American journalist Jackson Bentley is looking to highlight the \"more adventurous aspects\" of war to help draw the United States into the fight . Ali urges Lawrence to slow down, but Lawrence ignores him. Farraj is injured on one raid, and Lawrence kills him to save him from the Turks, who torture their captives. The Turks capture Lawrence while he scouts Deraa . The Turkish Bey orders him stripped, ogled, prodded and beaten—and, it is implied, raped. Ali rescues him and nurses him back to health. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken and humbled. Dryden informs Lawrence about the Sykes–Picot Agreement , which will partition the Middle East between Britain and France . Allenby urges Lawrence to return to Arabia to support the \"big push\" on Damascus . Lawrence feels betrayed but complies. He recruits an army with little interest in Arab liberation. Lawrence hopes that if the Arabs can take Damascus before the British, they will be able to demand an independent Arab state. Lawrence's army sights a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just massacred the residents of Tafas . One of Lawrence's men is from Tafas and demands no prisoners . Ali insists on proceeding to Damascus, but the man charges alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up his battle cry, and the Arabs massacre the Turks. The Arabs beat the British to Damascus. Lawrence advises them to run the city without British support, but the tribesmen bicker constantly, the public utilities fail, and the understaffed hospitals barely function. Feisal discards Lawrence's dream of Arab independence in exchange for British support. Lawrence returns to the British Army. The British promote Lawrence to colonel and order him to Britain.

Later, her father discovers that bonds worth $50,000, intended as a wedding present for his daughter, are missing. The only other person who knows the combination of the safe in which they were kept is his secretary and mistress, Julia Wolf. When he confronts Julia about the missing bonds, she confesses that she cashed them in and has only $25,000 left. He threatens to call the police unless she comes up with the other $25,000. Nick Charles is a retired detective who once did a job for Clyde. Nick and his wealthy wife, Nora, live in San Francisco but are visiting New York City for Christmas, staying in a glamorous apartment-like suite at the Hotel Normandie. While in New York, Nick is pressed back into service by Dorothy, as her father, the \"Thin Man\" of the title, had left on a secret business trip with a promise to return home before his daughter's wedding, but he has mysteriously disappeared. According to his attorney, Herbert MacCauley, he had been sending money to Wynant from time to time while Wynant was away on his trip. Dorothy convinces Nick to take the case, with the assistance of his socialite wife, who is eager to see him in action. What appears to be a missing person situation rapidly turns into a murder case when Julia Wolf is found dead and evidence points to Clyde as the prime suspect. Dorothy refuses to believe that her father is guilty. Nick and Police Lieutenant Guild visit Arthur Nunheim, a petty criminal who regularly provides information to the lieutenant. After being pressed for information, Nunheim excuses himself momentarily, only to slip away down the fire escape. Later he arranges a meeting with the yet-unidentified murderer to collect $5,000 from him, in exchange for keeping quiet about the murder. When Nunheim arrives, however, he is immediately shot four times and killed with what police find was the same gun that killed Julia Wolf. Police think Wynant is guilty of both murders after his ex-wife, Mimi Wynant Jorgenson, provides evidence that implicates him. On a hunch, Nick visits Wynant's closed shop in the dead of night and uses his dog Asta's nose to find a skeletonized, but fully dressed, body, buried under the floor. In the dark shop, Wynant's former bookkeeper, Tanner, a man known to Nick as an ex-con, suddenly appears. He had been hired by Julia Wolf and admits to having stolen money from Wynant, claiming to have come back to return the money and \"clean up the books.\" When the police arrive, they conclude that Wynant committed the murders of Julia, Nunheim, and this newly discovered body, assuming that the remains belong to the \"Fat Man\"—a long-ago enemy of Wynant's—because of its oversized clothing with a belt buckle bearing an \"R\" (for \"Rosebreen\", that notorious figure's surname). Nick—who had accompanied the medical examiner when he X-rayed the buried body—theorizes that the clothes were planted to hide the body's true identity of Clyde Wynant, as the X-ray revealed telltale shrapnel which matched Wynant's old war wound. Nick deduces that the real culprit murdered Clyde once he discovered that the killer had been embezzling from him. The culprit then murdered his own accomplice, Julia Wolf, because she knew about Clyde's murder, and after that, he murdered Nunheim since he had witnessed Julia's murder and was blackmailing him. Since Nick has already all but solved the case, he invites the full cast of suspects to an elegant dinner party to expose the murderer. Nick unfurls his theory to the dinner guests, informing them that Wynant isn't the killer, and that he saw Wynant the night before (not revealing he meant Wynant's corpse). Several guests claim to have also seen Wynant the night before. As Nick provides potential evidence about each guest as the possible murderer, Wynant's attorney Herbert MacCauley panics and tries to shoot Nick. Nick punches him out and declares MacCauley to be the murderer. After murdering Wynant and then Wolf, MacCauley had sought to clean out Wynant's bank account by making it look like Wynant was just away on a business trip. He also paid off Wynant's ex, Mimi Wynant Jorgenson, to throw police off the scent in Julia Wolf's murder, having her provide evidence to the police that would implicate her cheating ex-husband in that case. He didn't inform Mimi that Wynant was dead, and that she was entitled to her ex-husband's entire estate, not just the small bribe MacCauley paid her. Later, Nick and Nora, along with Dorothy and her new husband Tommy, celebrate as they ride a luxury train back to California. Nora, in the lower bunk, wants to sleep with Asta, but Nick tosses Asta to the upper bunk and joins Nora himself. Asta looks down on the couple and covers his eyes with his paw.

Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights Merrick's physical abnormalities. In particular, Merrick's deformed skull forces him to sleep sitting up, as lying down would asphyxiate him. Bytes savagely beats him after the lecture, and Merrick is sent back to the hospital. The matron, Mrs Mothershead, reluctantly tends to him, as the other nurses are too frightened of him. Treves diagnoses Merrick with an intellectual disability . His boss, Mr. Carr Gomm, points out that if he is right, Merrick cannot stay, as the hospital does not accept \"incurables\". It turns out that Merrick is actually intelligent and can speak, albeit with severe difficulty. To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say basic conversational sentences and part of the 23rd Psalm to Carr Gomm. Merrick is so nervous that he cannot respond to questions coherently, prompting Carr Gomm to excuse himself. As he is leaving, Merrick proves his intelligence and his ability to read by reciting the entire 23rd Psalm from memory. Although Merrick's physical condition is incurable and he has no mental condition to cure, Carr Gomm allows him to stay. Treves slowly broadens Merrick's world. He gives Merrick supplies to build a model of the nearby St Philip's Church . He invites Merrick to tea with his wife Ann, where they exchange photos of their families. Merrick tells Ann that he must have been a disappointment to his mother, but hopes she would be proud to see him with friends, which brings Ann to tears. Overwhelmed by the shock of being treated with kindness, Merrick also cries. Fashionable society takes an interest in Merrick. Actress Madge Kendal gives him a copy of Romeo and Juliet ; Merrick is fascinated by the theatre, but has never seen a play. The two perform a romantic dialogue from the play, which culminates in a kiss. In addition, Queen Victoria and Princess Alexandra arrange for him to be permanently admitted to the hospital. However, other society guests treat Merrick with visible disgust. Mothershead, who has grown to respect Merrick, realizes that Victorian society makes a show of helping Merrick to reassure itself of its own Christian values; the film periodically highlights society's indifference to the poor. She compares Treves to Bytes' freak show, which shakes him greatly. A new freak show begins when Jim, an unscrupulous hospital employee, begins selling tickets to gawk at, and sometimes physically torment, Merrick. Bytes buys a ticket, kidnaps Merrick, and spirits him to a freak show on Belgium. The next morning, Treves accuses Jim for lying and getting involved with Bytes to kidnap Merrick, and Mrs. Mothershead hits Jim with a package and fires him in the process. Merrick's health rapidly deteriorates during the show, and he collapses in front of the audiences; an audience member spat at Bytes in disgust. To punish him, Bytes drunkenly cages him in captivity with monkeys. The boy and other freak show attractions break him out and send him to England. In Liverpool Street station , three boys harass him. Merrick flees and accidentally knocks down a girl, prompting an angry mob to chase him. Defenceless, he cries out, \"I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man!\" and faints. [ 5 ] The police bring Merrick back to the hospital. Treves and other people in the hospital realize that Merrick is dying, and tries to make his final days comfortable. He apologizes to Merrick for his ordeal, but Merrick says he is happy and fulfilled due to Treves' efforts. Treves responds that Merrick has helped him too. Princess Alexandra invites Merrick to the royal box for a pantomime , his first-ever show. Kendal dedicates the performance to him. Treves prompts Merrick to show his face to the crowd, which gives him a standing ovation. Back at the hospital, Merrick and Treves bid each other goodnight, and Merrick completes his church model. He lies down to sleep, as he has always dreamed of doing. As he dies, he sees a vision of his mother, who quotes Lord Tennyson 's \"Nothing Will Die\".",

Wallace and Bergman firmly stand their ground against the Sheikh's armed and hostile bodyguards, who attempt to intimidate and disrupt their interview preparations. Later, Bergman approaches Jeffrey Wigand—a former executive at the Brown & Williamson tobacco company—for help explaining technical documents. Wigand agrees but intrigues Bergman when he insists that he will not discuss anything else, citing a confidentiality agreement . Brown & Williamson coerces Wigand into a more restrictive agreement, leading Wigand to accuse Bergman of betraying him. Bergman subsequently visits Wigand to defend himself and investigate the potential story. Although Wigand apparently possesses very damaging information, he hesitates to reveal anything, fearing that it will jeopardize his severance package from Brown & Williamson. Wigand's family moves into a more modest house, and Wigand begins working as a teacher. One night, Wigand finds evidence of trespass and receives a sinister phone call. Meanwhile, Bergman contacts Richard Scruggs , an attorney representing Mississippi in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Bergman suggests that if they depose Wigand, making his information public, it can give CBS cover to broadcast the information; Scruggs expresses interest. Wigand receives an emailed death threat and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the FBI , but the agents who visit him are hostile and confiscate his computer. Furious, Wigand demands that Bergman arrange an interview, during which Wigand states that he was fired after objecting to Brown & Williamson intentionally making their cigarettes more addictive. Bergman arranges a security detail for Wigand's home, and the Wigands experience marital stress. Wigand testifies in Mississippi, despite attempts of intimidation and legal suppression by Brown & Williamson attorneys. After returning home, he discovers that his wife Liane has left him and taken their daughters. Eric Kluster, the president of CBS News , decides not to broadcast Wigand's interview after CBS legal counsel Helen Caperelli warns that the network is at risk of legal action from Brown & Williamson. Bergman confronts Kluster, accusing him of sacrificing journalistic integrity to protect the impending sale of CBS to Westinghouse , which would enrich both Kluster and Caperelli. Wallace and their executive producer Don Hewitt both side with Kluster. Wigand, learning of this, is appalled and terminates contact with Bergman. Investigators probe Wigand's personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that The Wall Street Journal intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand's credibility. He convinces the Journal 's editor to delay publication and assign journalists to investigate the dossier, claiming that it falsely quotes its sources. After infighting at CBS over the Wigand segment, Bergman is ordered to take a \"vacation\" as the abridged 60 Minutes segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, which is under threat from a lawsuit by Mississippi's governor. Bergman, frozen out, is unable to assist and privately questions his own motives pursuing the story. Bergman contacts an editor at The New York Times , disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The Times prints the story on the front page and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The Journal dismisses the dossier as character assassination and prints Wigand's deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. 60 Minutes finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand.

He weaves the characters into a narrative meant to comfort Valentin and distract him from the harsh realities of political imprisonment and separation from his lover, Marta. Valentin encourages Molina to have self-respect and opens him up to political commitment. Despite Valentin's occasionally snapping at Molina over his shallow views of film-watching and unrealistic romance, an unlikely friendship develops between the two. As the story develops, it becomes clear that Valentin is being poisoned by his jailers to provide Molina with a chance to befriend him, and that Molina is spying on Valentin on behalf of the secret police. Molina has apparently been promised parole if he succeeds in obtaining information that will allow the secret police to break up the revolutionary group. When Molina declares himself in love with Valentin, a physical consummation of that love occurs on Molina's last night in prison. Molina is granted parole in a surprise move by the secret police. Valentin provides Molina with a telephone number and a message for his comrades. Molina at first refuses to take the number, fearing the consequences of treason, but he relents, bidding Valentin farewell with a kiss. Now out of prison, Molina calls the telephone number, and a meeting is arranged with the revolutionary group. But the secret police have had Molina under surveillance, and at the rendezvous, a gun battle occurs, with the revolutionaries shooting Molina. As he wanders the streets wounded, the secret police catch him and demand the telephone number, but Molina refuses and dies. On the orders of the police chief, the policemen dump Molina's body in a rubbish pit and fabricate a story about his death and his presumed collaboration with the revolutionary group. In the prison, Valentin is being treated after being tortured. After a sympathetic doctor risks his job by administering morphine to help him sleep, Valentin appears to succumb to his wounds and perhaps die, when he suddenly finds himself running out of prison with Marta and appearing on an idyllic tropical island with her.

On October 28, 2003, Zuckerberg, a Harvard University sophomore, is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about her on his LiveJournal blog. Zuckerberg creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking and downloading photos of female students from house face books , then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation . Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of the Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya Narendra . The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection , a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Soon after, Zuckerberg approaches Saverin with an idea for \" TheFacebook \", a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of TheFacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers , who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on TheFacebook or Zuckerberg. Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me,\" which impresses them. As TheFacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to Yale , Columbia , and Stanford . Saverin begins dating Lee, who arranges for him and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker . Parker presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company, impressing Zuckerberg. Saverin dismisses Parker as paranoid and delusional outside of his suggestion to rename TheFacebook to Facebook . Zuckerberg relocates the company to Palo Alto based on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on business development, while breaking up with Lee. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin's annoyance. After narrowly losing in the 2004 Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub , the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford , Cambridge and LSE , and decide to sue the company for intellectual property theft . Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel . Saverin is invited to the company's new headquarters on the pretense of attending a business meeting and \"millionth user party,\" but is enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal dilutes his share of Facebook from 34% to 0.03%, without diluting the ownership percentage of any other owner. Furthermore, he has already been removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, vowing to sue as security removes him from the building. Shortly after, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users. He attempts to blame Saverin, prompting Zuckerberg to cut ties with him. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for Zuckerberg, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury.

Terence Fletcher (Simmons), the conductor of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, recruits him to play in the Studio ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner (Lang). Andrew discovers that Fletcher, although encouraging at first, is relentlessly strict and verbally and physically abusive towards his students. When he apparently fails to keep tempo on Hank Levy 's \" Whiplash \" during his first ensemble rehearsal, Fletcher throws a chair at him, repeatedly slaps his face, and berates him. Determined to impress Fletcher, Andrew excessively practices, often until his hands blister and bleed. In the meantime, Andrew goes on a date and becomes romantically involved with a woman named Nicole (Benoist). After their first set at a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Tanner's sheet music. Tanner cannot play without the sheets, so Fletcher assigns Andrew to perform \"Whiplash\" from memory, resulting in Shaffer winning the competition. Fletcher promotes Andrew to core drummer. However, Andrew is taken aback when Fletcher abruptly reassigns the position to Ryan Connolly (Stowell), a drummer from a lower-level ensemble within Shaffer. Because of his single-mindedness toward music, Andrew clashes with his family and breaks up with Nicole to focus on his ambitions. Fletcher begins rehearsal by announcing that Sean Casey, a former member of the Studio Band, died in a car crash. He then pushes the three drummers to play at a faster tempo on \" Caravan \", keeping them for a grueling five-hour practice. Andrew is the only one able to perform on-tempo, and earns the core position back. On the way to the next competition, Andrew's bus gets a flat tire. He rents a car but arrives late and forgets his drumsticks at the rental office, irritating Fletcher. Andrew races back and retrieves them, but his car is hit by a truck on the way back. Heavily injured, Andrew crawls from the wreckage and runs to the theater, arriving bloodied and weak just as the ensemble enters the stage. He struggles to keep tempo and Fletcher halts the performance to dismiss him from the band. Enraged, Andrew attacks Fletcher onstage and is subsequently expelled from Shaffer. At the request of his father, Jim (Reiser), Andrew meets Rachel Bornholdt (Grace), a lawyer representing the parents of the late Sean Casey, who had actually hanged himself after suffering from depression and anxiety resulting from Fletcher's abuse. Casey's parents want Fletcher held accountable, so Andrew reluctantly agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher. Andrew abandons drumming but encounters Fletcher months later playing piano at a jazz club . Over a drink, Fletcher admits his teaching methods were harsh but insists they were necessary to motivate his students. Citing a story where Jo Jones allegedly threw a cymbal at Charlie Parker as an example, Fletcher says that the next jazz musician to live up to Parker's legacy would never let discouragement stop them. Fletcher invites Andrew to perform with his professional band at a New York JVC Jazz Festival , playing the same pieces from the Shaffer Studio Band; Andrew accepts. Andrew calls Nicole to invite her to the performance but learns she has a new boyfriend. At the festival, Fletcher tells Andrew he knows Andrew testified against him. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band into a new song Andrew does not know. After a disastrous performance, Andrew walks offstage humiliated. Jim embraces Andrew backstage, but Andrew decides to return to the stage, reclaiming the drum kit and cutting off Fletcher's introduction to the next tune by cueing the band into \"Caravan\". Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues into an unexpected improvised solo . He plays continuously at an extraordinary speed to the point his hands start bleeding and he seemingly goes into a trance, while Jim watches in horror. Impressed, Fletcher nods in approval before cueing the final chord.",

    "plot": "In 1982, an enormous extraterrestrial spaceship arrives and hovers over the South African city of Johannesburg . Inside, an investigation team finds over a million malnourished insect-like aliens, and the South African government relocates them to a camp called District 9 . Over the years, District 9 becomes a slum, and locals come to view the aliens—derogatorily called \" Prawns \"—as filthy, violent animals who bleed resources from humans. Following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a large defense contractor, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints his son-in-law and MNU bureaucrat, Wikus van de Merwe, to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens named Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ, and his friend Paul search a District 9 garbage dump for Prawn technology; Christopher has spent the last 20 years synthesizing fuel from their contents. They finally fill an entire container in Paul's shack as the relocation begins, but when Wikus comes to serve Paul a notice, he finds the hidden container and accidentally sprays some fuel into his face. Koobus Venter, a cruel MNU mercenary, kills Paul. Wikus begins mutating into a Prawn, starting with his left arm that was injured after the exposure. He is taken to an underground MNU lab, where researchers discover his hybrid DNA grants Wikus the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, which is biologically restricted from humans. Seeing the potential for profitable weapons research, Smit orders Wikus' body to be harvested for genetic material. Wikus, however, overpowers the lab personnel and escapes. While Venter's forces hunt him, a fake news story is broadcast claiming Wikus is a wanted fugitive, who has contracted a contagious disease from copulating with aliens. Wikus takes refuge in District 9 , finding Christopher and the spaceship's command module dropship concealed underneath his shack. Christopher explains that the confiscated fuel is needed to reactivate the dropship, which can then dock with the mothership. This would allow Christopher to rescue his people and return home, and cure Wikus with the equipment onboard. Encouraged by a phone call from his wife, Tania, Wikus steals powerful alien weapons from Obesandjo, a Nigerian crime lord who believes eating Wikus' alien arm will grant him alien abilities. Wikus and Christopher attack MNU and reach the underground lab, where Christopher is horrified by the brutal experiments MNU has performed on his people. After seeing what MNU has done to his own kind, Christopher's priorities change. Christopher decides that he needs to get his people off of Earth immediately, and as a result, it will take more time for him to cure Wikus' condition. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher unconscious and attempts to fly the module to the mothership, but Venter has it shot down. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes them and abduct Wikus. CJ, who remained hidden in the dropship, remotely activates the mothership and a large robotic alien battle suit in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians; Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries. Heading towards the dropship, the two come under heavy fire; Wikus decides to stay behind and fend off the mercenaries, buying time for Christopher to escape, who promises to return in three years and cure Wikus. After all of the other mercenaries are killed, Venter finally cripples the suit, but several Prawns kill and dismember him before he can execute Wikus. Christopher makes it into the dropship with CJ, and the dropship is levitated via a tractor beam back into the mothership, which finally leaves Earth. Wikus disappears, MNU's experiments are exposed to the public, and the aliens are moved to a new camp named District 10 . Tania finds a handcrafted metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. Wikus, now fully transformed into a Prawn, is shown in a junkyard crafting more flowers for his wife.",

He wants his youngest son, John , to inherit his throne, while his estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine , reprieved from imprisonment in England by Henry for the holiday, favours their eldest surviving son, Richard , a proven warrior. Henry invites Philip II of France , son and successor of Louis VII , Eleanor's first husband, to settle some business. Louis had made a treaty with Henry pledging Philip's half-sister Alais , currently Henry's mistress, in troth to Henry's future heir; Philip demands either a wedding or the return of her dowry , the strategically important county of Vexin near Paris. Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard to wed and make him heir-apparent in return for Eleanor surrendering the Duchy of Aquitaine . She wishes to keep to John, buying with her gift her freedom. When the arrangement is revealed at the wedding, Richard, who coveted the Aquitaine himself, refuses to go through with the marriage – just as Henry anticipated. Perceiving treachery in Henry's ploy, John is manipulated by his middle brother, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany , to plot with Philip to make war on Henry in return for being named John's chancellor. Richard then plots with Philip while John and Geoffrey hide behind a curtain. Henry and Philip meet to discuss terms, with all three princes in hiding. Philip reveals that he had been caballing with John and Geoffrey, then with Richard separately, and that he and Richard may once have been lovers. Philip casts their romantic liaison as always having been a scheme. Richard emerges and decries this, but Philip, saying he had always loathed Richard's sight and touch, turns the knife deeper. Recognizing his sons' limitations and plottings against him, Henry dismisses all three as unsuitable heirs and endungeons them. He readies a train to travel to Rome to demand an annulment of his marriage to Eleanor by the Pope, intending then to wed and have new sons with Alais. She protests that he will never be able to release his treasonous offspring from prison as they will slay any new heir. Henry recognizes the peril to his plan and confronts all three sons at once. Condemning them to death, he raises his sword over Richard but brings the blade down harmlessly upon Richard's shoulder. Weeping, he lets the threesome escape.

That same day, a white lynch mob brutally murders Wylie and drags his body through town, leaving it hanging from a tree. Both Royce and Wylie are buried on the same day. Royce's widow, Edna Spalding, is left to raise their two young children, Frank and Possum, on a struggling cotton farm.

The next morning, she finds him chopping wood in her yard. She feeds him again, but Moze later steals silverware and is caught. When the police bring him back, Edna decides not to press charges and instead hires him officially. Edna's troubles mount when Denby insists she take in his blind brother-in-law, Will, a bitter World War I veteran, as a boarder. Will resents his new situation but gradually forms a bond with Edna's children, especially after rescuing Possum during a tornado that devastates part of the town. Meanwhile, Margaret's marriage begins to fall apart as her husband Wayne carries on an affair with Viola Kelsey, a married schoolteacher.

During the visit, everyone stays with Sarah and Harold Cooper. His other friends include Sam Weber, a television actor; Meg Jones, once a public defender and now a real-estate attorney; Michael Gold, a journalist for People magazine ; former talk-radio psychologist Nick Carlton, now an impotent Vietnam vet with a drug addiction; and Karen Bowen, an unfulfilled writer unhappily married to Richard, a conservative advertising executive. Also present is Chloe, Alex's girlfriend of four months who is much younger than Alex and had been living with him in Sarah and Harold’s basement. While out jogging early the next morning, Harold, violating SEC rules, tells Nick that a large corporation is about to buy his small company, which will make him rich and triple the value of the stock. He told Alex, making it possible for him to buy property in the area. Harold suggests Nick use the tip to get into a new line of work. During their conversation, it is revealed that Sarah and Alex had a brief affair five years earlier, which all the friends knew about. Nick comforts Harold by reminding him she did not marry Alex. Harold, Sarah, and Alex moved past it, but Sarah tells Karen her friendship with Alex was harmed by the affair. Richard goes home the next day, but Karen stays. Harold, Nick, Michael, and Chloe drive out to see the old house that Chloe and Alex were renovating. Meanwhile, Meg tells Sarah she is fed up with failed relationships and intends to have a child on her own. Believing she is ovulating, she plans to ask Sam to be the father of her child. (She approaches Nick first, only to discover she's the last to know about his impotency.) Michael, who continually flirts with Chloe, needs investors for a New York nightclub. At dinner, Sarah becomes tearful and wonders if their fervent '60s idealism was \"just fashion.\" Later that night, Meg approaches Sam, but he declines, feeling fatherhood is too great a responsibility as he already has an estranged child. Nick shares his drugs, with varying effects. The next day, Harold, a running shoe entrepreneur, gives everyone a pair. Nick goes to the old house and sits on the porch for hours, missing the Michigan football game. Michael offers to sire Meg's child, alluding to their one-time college encounter. During a halftime game of touch football, a local police officer escorts a sullen Nick back to the house after he runs a red light and becomes belligerent. Recognizing Sam, the officer offers to drop charges if he will hop into Nick's Porsche 911 the way his J. T. Lancer character does on TV. He tries but fails, injuring himself slightly. Nick angers Harold by accusing him of being friendly with cops. Harold chastises Nick, reminding him that this is his home and Nick's recklessness could put his reputation in danger. Karen tells a surprised Sam that she is in love with him and wants to leave Richard. He tells her his first marriage failed because of boredom and he does not want her to make the same mistake. Feeling led on, Karen angrily stomps off. Meg tells Sarah that Michael is the wrong choice. Sarah observes the warm phone conversation between her young daughter and Meg. Later, the group, confused over Alex's death, regrets losing touch with him. To everyone but Sam, it seems that Alex withdrew deliberately. Nick is particularly cynical and bitter about life, love, and friendship. Karen follows Sam outside to mollify him, and they have sex. Sarah pulls Harold aside, embracing him, telling him she has a favor to ask: \"It's about Meg...\" Meg goes to him and they make love, tenderly.

All of them are African-American women; the unit is segregated by race and sex . White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's Space Task Group , given her skills in analytic geometry . She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive. Mary is assigned to the space capsule heat shield team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader, Karl Zielinski, a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor , Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her degree in mathematics and physical science, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend all-white Hampton High School , despite her husband's opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes. Katherine meets African-American National Guard Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins to spend time with Katherine and her three daughters. The Mercury 7 astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut John Glenn goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex mathematical equation from redacted documents, as the Soviet Union 's successful launch of Yuri Gagarin increases pressure to send American astronauts into space. Harrison confronts Katherine about her \"breaks,\" unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile (800 meters) to use the nearest restroom designated for \"colored\" people. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to destroy the \"colored\" restroom signs and abolish restroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in high-level meetings to calculate the space capsule's re-entry point. Stafford instructs Katherine to remove her name from the reports, insisting that \" computers \" cannot be credited as authors, and her work is credited solely to Stafford. Informed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a \"permanent supervisor for the colored group,\" Dorothy learns that NASA has installed an IBM 7090 electronic computer, which threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, Dorothy sneaks out a book about Fortran and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as \"Mrs. Vaughan\". Making final arrangements for John Glenn's launch , the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsule's landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsule's heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrison's suggestion to leave the retro-rocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. Friendship 7 lands successfully. An epilogue notes that Mary obtained her degree and became NASA's first female African American engineer; Dorothy continued on as NASA's first African American supervisor; and Katherine, whom Stafford accepted as a coauthor, performed calculations for the Apollo 11 and Space Shuttle missions. The epilogue also mentions that Katherine was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, and NASA dedicated the Langley Research Center 's Katherine Johnson Computational Building in her honor the following year.",

    "plot": "In February 1943, a contingent of British prisoners of war , led by Colonel Nicholson, arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand . United States Navy Commander Shears describes the horrific conditions to Nicholson, who forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered to surrender by their own headquarters. Colonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the prisoners the camp needs no fences because the surrounding jungle makes escape impossible and that they will be used as labour to construct a bridge over the River Kwai for the railway connecting Thailand and Burma . Nicholson objects, citing the Geneva Convention exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, but Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns him there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box. Shears becomes the only survivor of an escape attempt and recuperates in British Ceylon after being tended to by Thai civilians. British sabotage and deliberately slow work impedes bridge construction, made worse by incompetent Japanese engineering. When Nicholson is released from confinement, he is shocked by the poor job his men have done and orders the construction of a proper bridge that he feels will be a lasting tribute to the British Army 's superiority. Clipton unsuccessfully argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Even though Saito had given in to his principled stand and excused the British officers from manual labour, Nicholson volunteers them to join in the physical work. Shears' comfortable life in Ceylon is shaken up when Major Warden tries to recruit him for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears reveals he impersonated an officer to get better treatment in the camp, but Warden already knew of his deception and arranged his attachment to the British military, forcing him to participate. Warden, Shears, Chapman and Joyce parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies on landing, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Thai women guide the trio to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives at the base of the bridge towers and plan to destroy it and the first train to cross, scheduled for the next morning. Sunrise reveals the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson calls for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. After Joyce is shot, Shears swims across the river to detonate the explosives but is fatally wounded. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \"What have I done?\" Warden fires a mortar , wounding Nicholson. Dazed, Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge; the train tumbles into the river. Warden, turning toward the group’s horrified guides, pleads, \"I had to do it! They might have been taken alive!\". Witnessing the carnage, Clipton exclaims, \"Madness! ... Madness!\"",

After a standoff and punishment, the senior officer is eventually released and surprisingly becomes determined to build an excellent bridge as a testament to his army's capabilities, despite objections from the medical officer. Meanwhile, an escaped prisoner is recruited by a military officer for a covert mission to destroy the bridge. A small team parachutes into the region, facing casualties and challenges. Under darkness, two commandos plant explosives at the bridge's base, planning to destroy it and an approaching train. At dawn, their plan is complicated when the river level drops, exposing their sabotage equipment. The senior officer discovers the plot, and in the ensuing confrontation, multiple soldiers are killed. Ultimately, the bridge is destroyed when the senior officer, wounded and seemingly in shock, falls onto the detonator as the train approaches, causing it to plunge into the river. The surviving military officer justifies the mission, while a witness declares the entire scenario as complete madness."

    "plot": "Jerry Maguire is a slick 35-year-old sports agent working for Sports Management International (SMI). After criticism from an injured player's son triggers an epiphany, he writes a mission statement about perceived dishonesty in business and his desire to work with fewer clients to produce a better, more caring personal relationship with them. In response, SMI management sends Bob Sugar, Jerry's protégé, to fire him. This spurs both men to race to call every one of Jerry's clients to retain them. Jerry speaks to Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell, one of his smallest clients who is disgruntled with his pay. Rod tests Jerry's resolve through a long tirade on his lack of contract extension. By the conclusion of the conversation, Jerry has retained Rod but lost his other clients to Sugar. Leaving the office, Jerry loudly announces that he will start his own agency and asks if anyone will join him, to which only 26-year-old single mother Dorothy Boyd agrees. Frank \"Cush\" Cushman, a superstar quarterback prospect who is expected to be the number one pick in the NFL draft , initially says he will also stay with Jerry after he makes a personal visit to the Cushman home. Frank's father insists on a handshake deal based on his word instead of a signed contract, but Jerry eventually realizes that Cush and his father have secretly signed with Sugar the night before the NFL draft after seeing Jerry spend time to introduce Rod to other football executives. After an argument, Jerry breaks up with his disgruntled fiancée Avery who was emotionally unsupportive. He then turns to Dorothy, becoming closer to her young son, Ray, and eventually starts a romantic relationship with her. Jerry concentrates all his efforts on Rod, now his only remaining client, who turns out to be difficult to satisfy. In need of money, Jerry calls in a favor to get a contract extension from Rod's current team, the Arizona Cardinals, but receives a lowball offer and Rod needs that 10 million dollar deal for his family to live on. Rod and his wife decide to pass on the offer despite Jerry's warning that if he gets injured, he will receive nothing. Without any money coming in, Dorothy knows that Jerry is unable to afford payroll, so she decides to move to San Diego for a more secure job offer with health benefits. Afraid of losing her, Jerry proposes marriage to share health benefits, and as she is smitten, she agrees. Over the next several months, Rod and Jerry grow closer through a series of open and difficult conversations as they struggle to secure him a contract; Rod tells Jerry that he wants him to be honest, while Jerry tells Rod, \"help me help you,\" convincing him to stop complaining and start playing with his heart. Rod takes Jerry's advice, playing well and advancing the Cardinals. Jerry's marriage with Dorothy struggles however, so she suggests they amicably separate before losing too much of their lives to each other. During a Christmas Day Monday Night Football game between the Cardinals and the Dallas Cowboys , Rod catches a winning touchdown that secures the playoffs for the Cardinals, but appears to receive a serious injury . After a few scary minutes, he regains consciousness and celebrates with a dance for the wildly cheering crowd . After the scare and the widely televised recovery, Jerry and Rod embrace in front of the media and show how their relationship has progressed from strictly business to a close personal one, which was one of the points Jerry made in his mission statement. Triggering a realization, Jerry immediately flies home, finding Dorothy in a meeting of her sister's divorcee support group. The group watches as Jerry gives an impassioned speech telling Dorothy he needs her and \"you complete me,\" to which she responds, \"shut up… you had me at hello.\" Rod appears on ESPN's Up Close with Roy Firestone . On air, he learns Jerry has secured him a massive $11.2 million contract with the Cardinals, allowing him to finish his pro football career in Arizona . Rod breaks down and thanks everyone, extending warm gratitude to Jerry. Jerry and Dorothy celebrate as Jerry is introduced to other pro athletes who have seen his work with Rod.

    "plot": "Fur trapper Hugh Glass watches as American soldiers burn down a Native American village on the Great Plains . Years later, in late 1823, during the Arikara War , Glass guides Captain Andrew Henry 's trappers through the unorganized territory of the present-day Dakotas . While he and his half- Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by an Arikara war party which is seeking to recover its chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. Many of the trappers are killed during the fight, and the rest of them escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, the survivors begin a trek to Fort Kiowa on foot because Glass believes traveling down the Missouri River will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stash their pelts near the shore. While scouting game, Glass is mauled and left near death by a grizzly bear . Fearing another Arikara attack, trapper John Fitzgerald argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but he is unable to pull the trigger. Instead, he offers to pay anyone who will stay with Glass and bury him after he dies. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger , Fitzgerald, wanting the money to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts, also agrees to stay. After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is stopped when Hawk intervenes. Fitzgerald stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. At first Bridger protests, but he ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. Bridger leaves behind a canteen on which he had engraved a spiral symbol. The next morning, Bridger forces Fitzgerald to admit that there are not pursuing Arikara. They reach the fort, and Fitzgerald falsely reports to Henry that Hawk vanished and Glass died. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, but remains unaware of Hawk's murder. Glass starts an arduous journey through the wilderness, bringing Bridger's canteen with him. He performs a crude cauterization of his wounds and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into river rapids. He encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who tells Glass that \"revenge is in the Creator 's hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel together. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a sweat lodge for the feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover that French Canadian hunters have lynched Hikuc. Glass infiltrates the hunters' camp and sees their leader, Toussaint, raping Powaqa. Glass frees her; with a knife provided by Glass, she threatens Toussaint with castration to silence him from alerting the other Frenchmen and then flees while Glass kills several hunters and recovers Hikuc's horse, leaving Bridger's canteen behind. The following day, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and drives over a cliff on his horse as he escapes their pursuit. He survives the night by disemboweling the dead horse and sheltering nude inside its carcass. A French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes the man's spiral-engraved canteen. Believing that it was stolen, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing that Glass is alive, empties the outpost's safe and flees, intending to reach Texas . The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger upon returning to the fort, but Glass vouches for him, saying Bridger was deceived by Fitzgerald, who murdered Hawk. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald. After the two men split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills, and scalps Henry. Glass props up Henry's corpse on his horse to act as a decoy, taking its place himself to ambush Fitzgerald and shoot him in the shoulder. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank, where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Their chief, Elk Dog, kills Fitzgerald by stabbing him in the head and then scalps his body, and the Arikara (who have found Powaqa) spare Glass.

    "plot": "The Hubbards, a wealthy but corrupt family, are entertaining a dinner guest, William Marshall, a prominent Chicago businessman with whom they hope to partner in an enterprise to build a cotton mill in their sleepy Alabama town, called Paltou, taking advantage of low wages paid to workers. Marshall looks favorably on the plan and invites Regina Giddens to let him show her Chicago. After he leaves, Regina reveals that she plans to move to Chicago, taking her 17 year old daughter, Alexandra, with her. She plans to finally live the privileged life she believes she deserves, away from the backward place where they presently live. Regina, thoroughly scheming, proceeds to drive a hard bargain with her equally scheming brothers, Oscar and Ben, for a forty-percent share of the mill in exchange for persuading Horace to invest $75,000, only a one-third share. She sends Alexandra to Baltimore to bring her father home, supposedly because Regina misses him. When Alexandra accuses childhood friend, David Hewitt, a journalist for the local newspaper, of not liking anyone in her family, he teases her saying he likes one person — her papa. Bidding her farewell at the train station as she leaves to pick up her father, he instructs her to open her eyes to circumstances surrounding her and to “think for yourself.” On her trip, he encourages her to widen her world, speak to strangers, and go beyond the societal conventions for women. Realizing that she will resent him for revealing truths about her unsavory family, he gently prods her to increase awareness. On another occasion, when asked by Regina whether he is courting her daughter, David replies that at present he is not declaring his intention, but that if he decides to do so, he will not care whether or not she approves. Oscar, having married and abused the sweet-souled, fragile, now-alcoholic Birdie only to acquire her family's plantation , Lionnet, and its cotton fields, now schemes to consolidate the family wealth by a marriage between his son, Leo, and Alexandra, but neither Horace nor Regina like the idea. When Horace dislikes the proposal to invest in the cotton mill, Regina continues to press him, making him aware of her mercenary motives for asking him to return home. While the two of them argue upstairs, the brothers find an alternative. Leo, a teller at the bank, will “borrow” Horace's railroad bonds from his safe deposit box. They will use them as security for the construction, returning them long before it is time to clip the coupons . Gloating, Ben tells a furious and bewildered Regina they don't need her. Birdie, Alexandra, Horace, David, and Addie, the family's housekeeper have a little party while Regina is at David's mother's house, getting her dresses fitted. Birdie reveals that she drinks while realizing that she was miserably unhappy in her marriage, knowing Oscar married her for her family's land, and that she disliked her own son. Sobbing, Alexandra escorts Birdie back to her house. The next day, Horace checks the content of his safe deposit box in the Hubbard-owned bank, of which he is president, and finds that the bonds are missing. When Regina learns that her brothers have “borrowed” the bonds without permission, she threatens her brothers and nephew with exposure and sending them to jail unless they give her 75% of the venture’s profit. Quarreling alone with Regina, Horace intends to frustrate and punish his contemptuous wife’s scheming by claiming he lent her brothers the bonds. She would only be entitled to repayment of the loan without any share of the profits. He also announces that he has changed his will with the help of his attorney, Saul Fowler, leaving Regina with the bonds, while the rest of his estate would go to Alexandra. Regina spews her hatred for him, informing him that she never loved him and had grown contemptuous of his unquestioning acceptance of her constant excuses for rejecting his affections. During the quarrel, Horace suffers a heart attack, and Regina callously refuses him heart medication. Normally confined to a wheelchair, he collapses attempting to climb up a staircase to reach his medication while Regina makes no move to help. Only after he collapses, does she call her servants to help her bring him to his room. However, Horace dies soon after. Regina now forces her brothers to give her 75% ownership of the business, threatening to reveal their crimes to the local magistrate, and them being jailed. While Oscar is infuriated with the loss of the money and power that he so wanted, Ben takes the loss more philosophically, saying that he must accept it for now, but the situation may turn. For example, he might begin to ask what a man in a wheelchair was doing on a staircase. A bewildered Alexandra overhears this. “What was Papa doing on the staircase?” She asks her relatives. Alexandra becomes aware of her mother’s and uncles’ perfidy. She confronts her mother telling her that she wasn't going to stand by and watch people eat the earth and causing all kinds of hurt. Comforting her, David gently tells her that she had to learn the truth by herself; she would have resented anyone who told her about her family. Alexandra and David leave town and her poisonous family for a new life together. Regina is left utterly alone: her daughter has left, her husband has died on account of Regina's willful neglect, and her brothers are unable to be trusted.",

Jake's brother Joey discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts. Still, he repeatedly refuses the Mafia's help, wanting to win the championship on his terms. Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, despite being already married, and Vickie is underage. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson , and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting in the Army the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie, but he is controlling and domineering over her, and constantly worries that she has feelings for other men. His jealousy is evident when he brutally beats his next opponent, Tony Janiro , in front of Tommy Como, the local mob boss , and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana , he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who implies that she is dissatisfied in her marriage with Jake. Under the mistaken impression that Vickie is having an affair with Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como orders them to apologize to each other, but has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive . Jake purposely loses his next match against Billy Fox , and is booed out of the building after putting up a lackluster performance.

Gypo later runs into his friend and IRA comrade Frankie McPhillip, a fugitive with a £20 bounty on his head. Frankie, tired of hiding for six months, is on his way home to visit his mother and sister Mary under cover of the foggy night. The slow-witted Gypo decides to turn informer for the £20 reward, enough for passage to America for the both of them. The Black and Tans find Frankie at his house, and Frankie is killed in the ensuing gunfight. The British contemptuously give Gypo his blood money and let him go. Gypo subsequently buys a bottle of whiskey and tells Katie that he obtained money by beating up an American sailor . He goes to Frankie's wake, and acts suspiciously when coins fall out of his pocket. The men there tell him that they do not suspect Gypo of informing, but he then meets with several of his former IRA comrades, who wonder who informed on Frankie. Gypo claims it was a man named Mulligan. Though Gypo is drunk and talking nonsense, the others begin to suspect him but do not have enough evidence as yet. Gypo leaves and gives out £1 notes to a blind man and some bar patrons, but people wonder why he had such a sudden influx of cash. Meanwhile, Mary tells the IRA that the only person Frankie talked to that day was Gypo, and the men decide to hold an inquest into the death. Gypo goes to an upper-class party to look for Katie, but gets drunk and buys rounds of drinks. Gypo is then taken away by his former IRA comrades when they figure out he was likely the informant.

    "plot": "In 2005, Japanese archaeologists explore tunnels on Iwo Jima , where they find something in the dirt. In 1944 Iwo Jima , Private First Class Saigo, a conscripted baker who misses his wife and newly-born daughter, is digging beach trenches with his platoon when Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi arrives to take command of the garrison. He saves Saigo from a beating by Captain Tanida for being \"unpatriotic\", and orders the garrison to tunnel underground defenses throughout the island. Kuribayashi and Lieutenant Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi , a famous Olympic gold medalist show jumper , clash with the other officers, who disagree with Kuribayashi's defense in depth strategy. Kuribayashi learns that Japan cannot send reinforcements and thus believes that the tunnels and mountain bunkers stand a better chance of holding out than relying entirely on the beach defenses. Poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions take their toll, and many die of dysentery . Replacement troops arrive, including Superior Private Shimizu, whom Saigo suspects is a spy from the Kempeitai sent to report on disloyal soldiers. Soon, American aircraft and warships bombard the island. A few days later, U.S. Marines land and suffer heavy casualties, but they overcome the beach defenses and attack Mount Suribachi . While delivering a message from Captain Tanida to Colonel Adachi, Saigo overhears Kuribayashi's retreat orders over the radio; Adachi instead orders his unit to commit honorable suicide . Many soldiers obey except Saigo and Shimizu, the former of whom convinces the latter to retreat and fight on. The Mount Suribachi survivors make a run for friendly lines, but Marines ambush and slaughter them. Saigo and Shimizu reach safety but are accused by Lieutenant Ito of cowardice. They are about to be summarily executed when Kuribayashi arrives and confirms his order to retreat. Against Kuribayashi's orders, Ito leads an attack on US positions, and many soldiers are killed. Lt. Col. Nishi reprimands Ito for his insubordination; in response, Ito leaves carrying several land mines and intends to throw himself under a US tank. Shimizu reveals to Saigo that he was dishonorably discharged from the Kempeitai because he disobeyed an order to kill a family's dog. Nishi befriends a wounded Marine and then reads a letter from the Marine's mother after he dies, garnering sympathy from the Japanese soldiers. Nishi is eventually blinded by shrapnel and orders his men to withdraw before committing suicide. Saigo and Shimizu decide to surrender, but Shimizu and another surrendering soldier are spotted by an officer, who is ordered to shoot potential deserters, before Saigo can join them. Shimizu escapes and is found by a Marine patrol. Shimizu and another Japanese prisoner are then unlawfully executed by one of their guards. Saigo and the remaining soldiers flee to Kuribayashi's position, which is ill-supplied. Saigo befriends Kuribayashi, and a counter-attack is planned. Kuribayashi orders Saigo to stay behind and destroy any vital documents, saving his life for a third time. That night, Kuribayashi leads a final night attack on a Marine encampment. Most of his men are killed, and Kuribayashi is critically wounded and dragged away by his aide, Lt. Fujita. Meanwhile, Ito has long abandoned his suicidal mission and is captured by Marines. The next morning, Kuribayashi orders Fujita to behead him with his Guntō , but Fujita is shot and killed by a Marine sniper. Saigo arrives, having buried a bag of letters before leaving headquarters. Kuribayashi asks Saigo to bury him where he will not be found, then draws his pistol — a M1911 gifted to him in the US before the war — and commits suicide. Saigo dutifully buries him. Later, a Marine platoon finds Fujita's body. Saigo reappears and attacks them, infuriated to see an American has taken Kuribayashi's pistol. Saigo is subdued and taken to the beach to recover alongside wounded Marines. Awakening on a stretcher, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles. Returning to 2005, the archaeologists complete their digging and reveal the bag of letters that Saigo buried.

Cedar gives his cynical troubleshooter, ex-newspaperman Cornelius Cobb, the task of keeping reporters away from Deeds. Cobb is outfoxed by star reporter Louise \"Babe\" Bennett, who appeals to Deeds' romantic fantasy of rescuing a damsel in distress by masquerading as a poor worker named Mary Dawson. She pretends to faint from exhaustion after \"walking all day to find a job\" and worms her way into his confidence. Bennett proceeds to write a series of enormously popular newspaper articles on Longfellow, portraying him as a madcap yokel who has suddenly inherited riches, giving him the nickname \"Cinderella Man\".

    "plot": "Bullying, uncouth junkyard tycoon Harry Brock checks into a hotel suite in Washington, D.C., with his brassy girlfriend, former showgirl Emma \"Billie\" Dawn, and his crooked lawyer, Jim Devery, to \"influence\" a politician or two. As a legal precaution, Devery presses Harry to marry Billie, as a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband . To hide and safeguard Harry's assets from the government, Devery persuades Harry to sign over many of his assets to the reliably docile and unquestionably obedient Billie. With aspirations to become a power broker among D.C. dignitaries, Harry likes to exert dominance over political figures he pays off, sometimes humiliating them when they are not sufficiently compliant. Though his own behavior is much worse, Harry is embarrassed by Billie's oblivious behavior with a prominent congressman's wife, disgusted with Billie's ignorance and lack of manners, which he believes reflect badly on him. When journalist Paul Verrall comes to interview him, Harry is impressed by his unintimidated and spirited demeanor. Offering Paul a hefty fee as a way of exerting dominance over a better-educated but underpaid member of the Fourth Estate , Harry hires Paul to educate Billie and give her some culture. Paul soon finds that Billie has a limited vocabulary and is completely uninterested in areas of common knowledge outside of her sphere. Attracted to Paul, Billie suggests they have a fling, reassuring him that Harry has always remained unaware because he does not pay attention to anything outside of his business interests. Paul demurs politely but shows Billie respect and patience, using her attraction to him to stimulate her interest in world affairs. Starting with reading the daily newspaper, Paul encourages Billie to circle items she does not understand. Initially, Billie circles every article she attempts to read and complains that she has to look up nearly every word. They discuss the related issues and vocabulary. Blossoming under Paul's encouragement and her own hard work, Billie learns about literature, history, politics and the law, and turns out to be much smarter than she or anyone else knew. Billie starts thinking for herself and applying her learning to her situation. She also falls in love with Paul, who begins to appreciate her intellectual development and reciprocate her feelings. When Billie begins to read the documents that Harry has her sign for businesses under her name, she disapproves of a crooked deal and refuses to sign. Harry reacts violently, striking her and forcing her to sign the contracts related to his crooked deal. After consulting a dictionary during the heat of the argument, Billie calls him a \"fascist\"; missing the mark, the increasingly out-of-his-depth Harry counters that he does not belong to any organized religion. Tension grows in Billie and Harry's relationship as he deals with her newfound inquisitiveness and independence. Growing wary, Harry tries to intimidate her into signing his assets back to him. With Paul's help, gathering evidence against Harry in a safe place as a precaution, Billie uses her leverage to escape from Harry's domination. She promises to give Harry back his property little by little as long as he \"behaves\" in his business dealings and leaves them alone. Later, when Paul and Billie are driving out of D.C., they are stopped for speeding by a traffic policeman who asks Paul for his \"license\"; Billie hands over their marriage license and the sympathetic officer lets them go. When Billie comments that their marriage was \"predestination\", the officer says that he does not know what that means, and Billie—the advocate for expanding vocabulary—responds, \"Look it up.\"",

Yochabel saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile . Rameses I's recently widowed daughter Bithiah finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy by naming him Moses , even though her servant Memnet recognizes the child's Hebrew heritage. Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general , winning a war with Ethiopia and establishing an alliance. Moses falls in love with the princess Nefretiri .  But, she is betrothed to whomever Sethi chooses to become the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua , who tells him of the Hebrew God. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed, not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the master builder, Baka. Moses reforms the treatment of slaves on the project, but Prince Rameses , Moses's adoptive brother and Sethi's son, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is merely making the slaves more productive, and after demonstrating the results, Sethi declares him the next Pharaoh. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet, but reveals the story to Moses after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house, where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam. Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace, so that he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he, too, is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the Hebrew overseer Dathan , who then reports to Prince Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi reluctantly declares Prince Rameses his sole heir, and Rameses banishes Moses to the desert. At this time, Moses learns of the death of his mother. Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in Midian . After defending seven sisters from Amalekites , Moses is housed with the girls' father Jethro , a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter Sephora . Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped from the hard labor imposed on the Hebrews in Egypt. While herding, Moses sees the burning bush on the summit of Mount Sinai and hears the voice of God. At God's command, Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews. Moses comes before Rameses, now Pharaoh Rameses II , to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a cobra . Jannes performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married. To convince Rameses of obliging to his wishes, Moses gets God to initiate plagues against Egypt . Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of Khnum , and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him that the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders that all first-born sons of Hebrews will die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the first-born sons of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Despairing at the loss of his heir, Rameses gives in to Moses' demands and frees the Hebrews, who begin the Exodus from Egypt. Bithiah reunites with Moses and goes with the Hebrews. After being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his chariots and pursues the Hebrews to the Red Sea . Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire , and parts the Red Sea . After the Hebrews make it across to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God. Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the Ten Commandments created by God in two stone tablets . Meanwhile, Dathan exploits the people to gain power, claiming that Moses is dead and urging a reluctant Aaron to construct a golden calf idol. A wild Saturnalia occurs and a decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews. After God informs them of the Hebrews' sins, Moses and Joshua descend from the mountain. Enraged at his own people's betrayal of God, Moses deems the Hebrews unworthy and smashes the tablets at the golden calf, destroying it and sending Dathan and his cohorts to Hell . The remaining Hebrews are forced to wander in the wilderness for 40 years as punishment for their sins. An elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards Canaan , though he cannot enter himself because he disobeyed God at the Water of Strife.

The heiress is upset that he flirted with another woman in her presence and abruptly leaves.\n\nThe next day, the artist calls the woman, but she tells him to leave her alone. Meanwhile, the heiress arranges a showing with a collector interested in his work. Before the meeting, the artist goes to the parfumerie where the woman works and his persistence finally wins her over. She agrees to meet him that evening, but wants to avoid public places; they share a romantic song and dance along a river. The woman then rushes off to meet the singer after his performance.\n\nThe singer tells the woman he is going on tour and proposes marriage to her. His pianist friend humorously daydreams about performing a famous musical piece in a concert hall. The heiress rents the artist a lavish studio and tells him she is planning an exhibition of his work in three months time. The artist initially refuses the studio but accepts on condition he will repay her when his work sells.\n\nAfter a month of courting, the artist brings the woman to his apartment building. When she suddenly rushes off in a waiting taxi, he is confused. The singer and the artist later discuss the woman they each love without realizing it is the same person. One night, the artist and the woman meet by the river. She informs him that she and the singer are to be married and will be going abroad. She feels duty-bound to the singer for protecting her during the war.\n\nAt a masked ball, the artist admits to the heiress that he loves the woman. When the singer overhears the artist and the woman saying goodbye, he realizes the truth. As the singer and the woman drive away, the artist fantasizes through an extended dance scene with the woman. A car horn breaks his reverie; the singer returns the woman to him. They embrace and leave together as the music ends."

Their son, Jody, a boy in his pre-teen years, is their only surviving child. Jody has a wonderful relationship with his warm and loving father. Ora, however, is still haunted by the deaths of the other children of the family she lost over the years, fearing that Jody will end up dying if she shows any love to the boy, leading Jody to find her unloving and unreasonable. One morning, Jody and his parents discover that a bear has appeared and killed a calf and young pig from among their stock. They set out after the bear, accompanied by Penny's dogs Perk, Rip and Julia. They catch up with the bear, but it is able to escape after Perk flees, Penny's gun misfires, and Julia is badly injured. Upset over Julia's injury and the broken gun, Penny decides to get a new shotgun in exchange for Perk. One day, as Penny and Jody are tracking down their missing hogs that had been stolen by the Forresters, a rattlesnake bites Penny before he kills it. Penny kills a doe and uses her liver to draw out the venom . Jody asks to adopt the doe's orphaned fawn . Penny permits it but warns Jody that the fawn will have to be set free when it grows up. When Jody goes to ask his friend Fodderwing, the youngest Forrester son, to name the fawn he discovers that Fodderwing has died. However, Buck Forrester tells Jody that Fodderwing had said that if he had a fawn he would name him Flag. Jody and his family attend Fodderwing's funeral, and at a generous request from the Forresters, Penny offers a eulogy about Fodderwing's kindness and wisdom with animals. As months pass, Jody and Flag become inseparable. One year later, Flag has grown up and become a nuisance to the household and farm; causing damage to  the farm and crops. After Penny is injured while trying to clear another field to make up for lost crops, Penny tells Jody that he and his mother have agreed that for Jody to keep Flag, he must replant lost corn, and build a taller fence around the cornfield. Jody works hard and even receives help from Ora with the fence, but during the night, Flag manages to jump the new fence and destroy the new corn. Penny orders Jody to take the deer out into the woods and shoot it. Jody takes Flag out but does not have the heart to kill it.  He orders the deer to go away and never return, but Flag comes back to their property, and again devours the corn crop. Ora shoots Flag with a double-barreled shotgun , discharging one of the barrels, but only wounding the deer. Penny orders Jody to put the deer out of its \"torment\". Rather than let his pet deer suffer an agonizing death, he follows his father's orders and kills Flag with the remaining shell. The loss of Jody's beloved pet deer proves too much for him to handle. Overwhelmed with anger and despair, Jody runs away from home. Three days later, he is unconscious and adrift on the river in a canoe when he is rescued by a friendly boat captain, who returns him home.

    "plot": "In the 1920s, Sean \"Trooper Thorn\" Thornton, an Irish-born American retired boxer , travels from Pittsburgh to his birthplace of Inisfree to purchase the old family farm. [ a ] Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property's current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean's bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister. Some village residents, including parish priest Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker -cum- bookmaker Michaeleen Óge Flynn, [ b ] trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry when he finds he was deceived, and the Widow Tillane knows nothing about the deal. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture (which she owns), but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry (which is his contribution). Mary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to the local Church of Ireland minister and fellow former boxer, the Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses (in Irish Gaelic ) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage. However, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for Dublin , hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the railway station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the five miles (8 km) back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dowry money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom \"no fortune, no marriage\". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the £350 (over £17,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean's defensive counter-punch. A donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules . This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate's home for supper, much to Mary Kate's amusement and delight. The next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a jaunting car driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage.",

Robert wants to sell his share of the family farm to Karl Oskar, only to learn that Karl Oskar has also considered going to America. Despite the potential for a better life, Kristina is unenthusiastic, not wanting to leave her homeland and concerns about the arduous journey. However, when daughter Anna dies after gorging on uncooked porridge that ruptures her stomach, a devastated Kristina agrees to Karl Oskar's plan to leave Sweden. Meanwhile, Danjel Andreasson, Kristina's uncle, is being persecuted by Brusander, the local provost , for rejecting the official religion and holding fundamentalist religious services at his home.

While walking through the city, the boy is sidetracked by the girlfriend and is kidnapped by the burglar and taken back to the hideout. The burglar is defied by the boy, who in turn is protected by the girlfriend. When the criminal warns the burglar to remain calm, the burglar threatens him with his life, should their operation be compromised. Realizing the burglar's violent nature, the criminal begins reconsidering his life as a thief but decides to keep to his old ways. Two caretakers visit the wealthy man after he begins searching for the boy's origin. They present a locket belonging to the boy's mother, who arrived at the workhouse penniless and died during childbirth. The wealthy man recognizes the locket and throws the two out for keeping the trinket and information. Meanwhile, the burglar forces the boy to take part in a house robbery. The robbery fails when the boy accidentally awakens the occupants, but he and the burglar get away. While they are gone, the girlfriend, fearful for the boy's life, goes to the wealthy man, confessing her part in the boy's kidnapping; however, she refuses to name the burglar out of loyalty. She promises to return the boy at midnight at a bridge. She then goes to a tavern. When the burglar and the boy appear, the burglar has his dog guard the boy. The girlfriend starts up a lively drinking song to distract the burglar, but the dog alerts him, who gives chase. As the boy and the girlfriend depart at the bridge, the burglar catches up to them and violently bludgeons the girlfriend. The burglar takes off with the boy, but the dog returns to where the girlfriend has succumbed to her injuries and alerts the police. The dog leads the wealthy man and an angry mob to the thieves' hideout. The burglar arrives there and demands money, as well as confessing that he killed the girlfriend. Upon seeing the approaching mob, the thieves disband and flee. The burglar runs off with the boy, using him as a hostage. During the evacuation, the criminal loses his prized possessions, which sink into mud. The burglar attempts to flee to an adjacent roof but is shot dead by the police. The criminal makes up his mind to change his ways, but the pickpocket appears with a stolen wallet. The two dance off into the sunrise together, happily determined to live out the rest of their days as thieves, while the boy returns to the wealthy man's home for good."

    "plot": "The Lemp sisters, Emma ( Gale Page ), Thea ( Lola Lane ), Kay ( Rosemary Lane ), and Ann ( Priscilla Lane ) are accomplished musicians in a musical family headed by their widowed father, Adam ( Claude Rains ), who plays the flute. Harpist Emma, the oldest daughter, is the object of a neighbor's affection, but she rebuffs Ernest's ( Dick Foran ) attentions. Thea, a pianist and the second eldest, is courted by wealthy Ben Crowley ( Frank McHugh ), another neighbor, but she is not sure she loves him. Kay, the third daughter, is a talented singer and has a chance at a music school scholarship but doesn't want to leave home. The youngest daughter is Ann, a violinist. One day, Ann's violin practice is interrupted by the sound of their front gate squeaking. She instructs the young man making free with it in the finer points of the art, and introduces him to an apparently disapproving passerby, Mrs. Ridgefield, a local gossip. This charmer is young composer Felix Deitz ( Jeffrey Lynn ), come to work at the foundation where Adam is Dean. He has a letter of introduction to Adam, and while they talk, the girls set the dinner table with the very best silver. All four daughters are attracted to Felix, and they soon invite him to room with the family. He also charms Aunt Etta. Felix hopes to win a prize with his latest composition. Enter Felix's friend Mickey ( John Garfield ), a cynical orchestral arranger whose hard life has given him a grim view of existence. He falls for Ann, and is crushed when she announces at Adam's birthday party that she and Felix are engaged. An hour before Ann and Felix are to marry, Mickey tells Ann how he feels—and that Emma is “insane” about Felix. Through a window, Ann observes Emma's distress when she ties Felix's tie before the ceremony. Everyone is wondering where Ann is when a telegram arrives, addressed to Emma, telling them she has eloped with Mickey. Ernest calmly steps in to tell the guests. Four months later, Ann and Mickey are living a hard life in New York City, professing love for each other but poor and unhappy. Mickey is invited to form a band and go to South America with some fellow musicians, but cannot afford passage. Ann forbids him to ask Ben for the money and asks Mickey if he would go if she weren't hung around his neck. The family meets at the Lemps' house for Christmas, except Kay, who is singing on the radio that night. Emma did not get together with Felix; she is now engaged to Ernest. Felix is alone and unhappy, though the composition Mickey helped to orchestrate won a prize: a contract with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. He is to leave that very night. While Kay sings Mendelssohn's  “ On Wings of Song ,” the camera passes over the listening family, revealing much. Ann, moved to tears, takes out her handkerchief and drops two pawn tickets . Felix sees them—one is for a bracelet he'd given her earlier in the year. Mickey drives Felix to the train station in Ben's car, dropping Ben at the drugstore. He apologizes to Felix, who says it is all in the past. Felix offers Mickey a loan, but Mickey refuses, musing that he must be a new man; the old Mickey would have taken it.  As the train pulls out, Felix presses an envelope into his hands and tells him to use it for Ann, “any way you think that will make her happy.” Mickey watches the train leave and is suddenly grim. He gets into the car and drives away. It begins to snow. He turns off the windshield wiper and presses the accelerator to the floor. In the kitchen, doing dishes, Emma tells Ann that she had thought she was in love with Felix and would have kept on thinking so and spoiled her life if Ann had married him, but she was awakened to Ernest's qualities when he took charge at the wedding. Ann bursts into tears—and Thea screams. Ben is in the hospital. Adam emerges from the hospital room to tell them that it isn't Ben, it's Mickey. He dies with Ann at his bedside. It is spring; the trees in the yard are heavy with blossom. The girls and Adam are playing the piece that opened the film. Ann hears the sound of the gate squeaking. It is Felix. The family watches from the house as she welcomes him home and they swing together—until Mrs. Ridgefield approaches. “This is where we came in,” Felix cries, and they run inside. Mrs. Ridgefield looks around and steps onto the gate. The camera pulls slowly back as she swings back and forth, a blissful smile on her face.",

Tom hates New York but reluctantly accepts, largely to take the opportunity to be alone and away from a life that does not satisfy him. During his initial meetings with Lowenstein, Tom is reluctant to disclose many details of their dysfunctional family's secrets. In flashbacks, he relates incidents from his childhood to Lowenstein in hopes of discovering how to save Savannah's life. The Wingo parents were an abusive father, Henry, and a manipulative, status-hungry mother, Lila. The father was a shrimp boat operator and, despite being successful, spent his money on frivolous business pursuits, leaving the family in poverty. Tom is also torn by his own problems but hides behind what he calls \"the Southern way\"—laughing at things instead of crying. For example, his wife Sallie is having an affair, and her lover wants to marry her. Tom and Lowenstein begin to have feelings for each other. After Tom discovers that she is married to Herbert Woodruff, a famous concert violinist, Lowenstein introduces Tom to her son Bernard, who is being groomed to become a musician as well but secretly wants to play football. Tom starts coaching Bernard along with attending sessions with Lowenstein to help his sister. He discovers that Savannah has been in such a dissociated state that she even had a different identity, Renata Halpern. As Halpern, she wrote books to disguise the Savannah side of her troubled life. Tom confronts Lowenstein over not revealing this information before, and they argue. To apologize, she asks him to dinner, and their relationship becomes closer. Tom has a fateful meeting with his mother and stepfather, bringing up painful memories. He reveals that, when he was 13, three escaped convicts invaded his home and raped him, his mother, and his sister. His older brother, Luke, killed two of the aggressors with a shotgun, while his mother stabbed the third with a kitchen knife. They buried the bodies beneath the house and never spoke of it again. Discovering that Tom has been coaching Bernard, Herbert orders Bernard to stop his football pursuits and return to his music lessons to prepare to leave for Tanglewood , a prestigious music academy. Tom spends a romantic weekend with Lowenstein at her country house. Savannah recovers and is released from the hospital. This recovery is due to finally learning about things she has repressed from her childhood, most notably the rapes. Her first suicide attempt at age 13 was after the rapes and murders of the three convicts. Tom then receives a call from his wife, who wants him back. He loves both Lowenstein and his wife, and he tells Lowenstein that he doesn't love his wife more, \"just longer.” Tom ends his relationship with Lowenstein and reunites with his wife and family but wishes that two lives could be given to each man and woman.

    "plot": "In England in 1685, Irish doctor Peter Blood is summoned to aid Lord Gildoy, a wounded patron who participated in the Monmouth Rebellion . Arrested while performing his duties as a physician , he is convicted of treason against King James II and sentenced to death by the infamous Judge Jeffreys . By the whim of the king, upon his advisor Lord Sunderland's counsel, Blood and the surviving rebels are transported to the West Indies to be sold into slavery. In Port Royal , Blood is bought by Arabella Bishop, the beautiful niece of local military commander Colonel Bishop. Attracted by Blood's rebellious nature, Arabella tries to improve his situation by recommending him as the physician to the colony's governor, Steed, who continually suffers from painful gout . Outwardly resentful toward Arabella, yet silently appreciative for her efforts on his behalf, Blood develops an escape plan for himself and his fellow prisoners. The plan is almost uncovered by the suspicious Colonel Bishop, who has one of Blood's men, Jeremy Pitt, flogged and interrogated. Blood is spared a similar fate when a Spanish man-o'-war attacks Port Royal. During the raid, Blood and his fellow prisoners seize the Spanish ship from its drunken night watch and sail away to begin lives of piracy in 1687. Captain Blood's crew quickly achieve great fame among the buccaneers of the Brotherhood of the Coast , with Blood himself deemed the greatest captain of the coast. When Governor Steed is unable to contain the pirate menace, Colonel Bishop is appointed governor. He sends Arabella to England on an extended holiday, but three years later, she returns to the Caribbean. Her ship, also carrying royal emissary Lord Willoughby, is captured by Blood's treacherous partner, the French buccaneer Captain Levasseur, who plans to hold them for ransom . Blood forces Levasseur to sell them to him, relishing the opportunity to turn the tables on Arabella. When Levasseur vehemently objects, despite having accepted Blood's payment, the two pirate captains duel, with Blood killing Levasseur. Blood offers Arabella valuable jewelry from his conquests as a sign of his love for her. Ungrateful for her \"rescue,\" Arabella is indignant at having been purchased by Blood and calls him a thief and a pirate. Although angered by her rejection, he orders his men to set sail for Port Royal, where he will deliver Arabella and Lord Willoughby, despite the danger to himself and his crew. As they approach Port Royal, they sight two French warships attacking the city; Bishop has left it undefended in his single-minded pursuit of Blood. With England now at war with France, Lord Willoughby pleads with Blood to save the colony, but the captain and his crew refuse to fight for the corrupt king. Willoughby reveals that James was kicked out of England and fled to France and is in hiding; England's new king, William III , has sent Willoughby to offer Blood and his men full pardons and commissions in the Royal Navy . This startling news quickly changes the pirates' minds, and they prepare for battle with the French. After having had Arabella ferried ashore, Blood and his men approach Port Royal flying French colors , but soon that ensign is replaced with the British Union Jack . A pitched ship-to-ship battle ensues, leading to frenzied hand-to-hand deck combat. Blood and his men defeat the French frigates, saving the colony, but not before losing their ship in the battle. As a reward for his daring action, Blood is appointed the new governor of Port Royal by Lord Willoughby, after which Arabella confesses that she loves him. Blood also has the pleasure of dealing with his hostile predecessor, having now returned from his pirate hunt and under arrest for abandoning his post in a time of war. As Arabella playfully pleads with the new governor to spare her uncle's life, Blood finally reveals his face to the astonished Bishop, greeting him with the phrase \"Good morning, Uncle\".",

George organizes a dinner party with his parents and the governor and pressures Rose into a piano performance. George reveals that Phil was a brilliant Classics student at Yale, in contrast to his rough nature. Shaken by Phil's earlier belittlement of her piano playing, Rose is unable to perform.

Peter enters a bivouac in the glade and finds a stash of Bronco Henry's homoerotic magazines. He observes Phil bathing in a pond with Bronco's scarf around his neck before Phil notices and chases him away. Later, in front of his men, Rose, and George, Phil makes amends with Peter, offering to plait him a lasso from rawhide before he returns to school. He teaches Peter to ride a horse.

It is evident that Phil and Bronco Henry had sex. They later share a cigarette by Peter passing it to Phil while holding it in his fingers.

The son pacifies the volatile brother by offering him strips from the hide he cut, not mentioning its origin. The volatile brother is touched by the son's gesture and holds him close to his face. The pair spend the night in the barn finishing the rope. Blood flows from the volatile brother's open wound as he swirls the hide in the solution used to soften it. The son asks the volatile brother about his relationship with his mentor. The volatile brother says the mentor had once saved his life when they were caught in a freezing storm in the mountains by keeping him warm with his body. The son asks if they were naked, but the volatile brother does not answer. It is evident that the volatile brother and his mentor had a sexual relationship. They later share a cigarette by the son passing it to the volatile brother while holding it in his fingers. The next morning, the kind brother finds the volatile brother sick in bed, his wound now severely infected. A delirious volatile brother looks for the son to give him the finished lasso, but the kind brother takes him to the doctor. The volatile brother dies. Later, the kind brother picks out a coffin for the volatile brother, while his body is prepared for burial. At the funeral, the doctor tells the kind brother that the volatile brother most likely died of a deadly disease. This puzzles the kind brother, as the volatile brother was always careful to avoid diseased cattle. The son, who skipped the funeral, opens a prayer book to a passage on burial rites and reads a biblical psalm before stowing the finished lasso under his bed with carefully gloved hands. As the son watches the kind brother and now-sober widow return home and embrace, he turns away and smiles."

    "plot": "Diana Scott is a bored young model married to a man named Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio, and it is there that their relationship starts. After liaisons in hotel rooms, they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the men of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the Glass Corporation, who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is juxtaposed with wealthy guests gorging themselves with food. Diana later becomes pregnant and decides to have an abortion to sustain her career. She flies to Paris with Miles for more jet-set sophistication. There she finds the wild party, beat music, strip dance mind game and cross-dressing repellent but slowly adjusts and holds her own, gaining the respect of the crowd when she taunts Miles during the game. On her return to London, Robert calls her a whore upon discovering her affair with Miles and leaves her. Miles then casts her as \"The Happiness Girl\" in the Glass Corporation's advertising campaign for a chocolate firm. Diana finds comfort in the company of gay photographer Malcolm, who has created her new famous look. They go shopping, where she randomly decides to shoplift several items. On location at a palazzo near Rome, Diana smiles in her medieval/Renaissance costume and completes \"The Happiness Girl\" shoot. She is taken with the beauty of the building and the landscape, getting on well with the prince, Cesare, who owns the palazzo. With the friendly Malcolm, Diana decides to stay in Italy. They stay in a simple house by a small harbour in Capri, where Diana flirts half-heartedly with Catholicism. They are visited by Cesare, who arrives in a huge launch, invites them on board and proposes to Diana. She politely declines his proposal, but Cesare leaves the offer open. Diana returns to London, still living in the flat she shared with Robert, where she has a party with Miles and other assorted media characters. Robert comes by to visit Diana but sees that she is with Miles and departs. Becoming disillusioned with Miles and the vacuous London jet set, Diana flirts with the Catholic church again. Impulsively, she flies to Italy and marries the prince, which proves to be ill-fated. Though waited on hand and foot by the servants, she is almost immediately abandoned in the vast palazzo by Cesare, who visits Rome frequently. Diana flees to London to visit Robert, and the two have sex, making her believe they are ready for a stable, long-term relationship. However, in the morning he tells her that he is leaving her and that he fooled her only as an act of revenge. He reserves a flight to Rome, packs her into his car and takes her to Heathrow airport to send her back to her life as Princess Della Romita. At the airport Diana is hounded by the press, who address her as Princess. She boards the plane to leave.",

    "plot": "In 1878, 14-year-old Mattie Ross travels to Fort Smith , Arkansas , after her father is murdered by hired hand Tom Chaney. Sent to collect her father's body, Mattie learns that Chaney has likely fled with \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory , where the local sheriff has no authority. She then inquires about hiring a deputy U.S. Marshal . The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses the \"meanest\" one, Rooster Cogburn, who initially rebuffs her offer, doubting both her grit and her wealth, but she raises the money by aggressive horse trading. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a state senator . LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not Texas . Mattie insists on traveling with Cogburn to bear witness to justice, but he departs without her, accompanying LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After catching up with the lawmen, Mattie is spanked for her \"insolence\" by LaBoeuf, until Cogburn draws his weapon on him. This, combined with their differing opinions of William Quantrill , prompts Cogburn to end his arrangement with LaBoeuf, who leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. At a rural dugout, Cogburn and Mattie find outlaws Quincy and Moon, who surrender after Cogburn shoots and injures Moon. Initially, the outlaws deny any knowledge of Ned Pepper or Chaney, but Cogburn, using Moon's worsening injury as leverage, convinces him to cooperate. Quincy, enraged, stabs Moon and is killed by Cogburn. A dying Moon reveals that Pepper's gang will arrive at the dugout that night for supplies. Cogburn and Mattie plan an ambush, but LaBoeuf arrives first and is confronted by the gang. Cogburn shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. Due to his substantial injuries, LaBoeuf rejoins Cogburn and Mattie. The next morning, the three set off again in pursuit of Chaney and the gang, whom Cogburn believes may be hiding out in the Winding Stair Mountains . Cogburn begins to drink heavily, and the animosity between LaBoeuf and him resumes. After days of searching, the three find no trace of Chaney or the Pepper gang. Drunk, Cogburn declares that the trail has gone cold and quits the pursuit. LaBoeuf leaves the posse, declaring that he will return to Texas. Mattie expresses regret to LaBoeuf that she hired the wrong man, and they reconcile, with both admitting they misjudged each other. While retrieving water from a stream, Mattie happens upon Chaney. She shoots and wounds him, but her revolver misfires, allowing Chaney to take her hostage. Ned Pepper convinces Cogburn to leave the area by threatening to kill Mattie. Pepper then departs with his gang, stating that someone will return with a fresh horse for Chaney and instructing him to not harm Mattie while they wait, threatening not to pay him should he disobey. Chaney, musing that Pepper has abandoned him to be captured by the law, attempts to kill Mattie. LaBoeuf arrives and knocks Chaney unconscious, revealing that Cogburn and he reunited shortly after the initial gunfight. He was to rescue Mattie while Cogburn intercepts the gang in a four-to-one standoff. Cogburn and the outlaws charge at each other headlong, with Cogburn killing two gang members and forcing a third to flee before his own horse is shot and falls, trapping him. Alone and mortally wounded, Pepper prepares to execute Cogburn, but LaBoeuf shoots Pepper from 400 yards with his rifle . Chaney regains consciousness and knocks out LaBoeuf, but Mattie seizes the rifle and shoots Chaney dead. The recoil knocks her into a snake den, where she is bitten in the hand by a rattlesnake . Cogburn ropes in, shoots the snakes and rescues Mattie, thanking LaBoeuf and promising to send help for him before departing with Mattie to reach a doctor. After their horse collapses from exhaustion, Cogburn shoots the horse and carries a delirious Mattie on foot to reach help. Despite staying with Mattie until she is out of danger, Cogburn is gone by the time she regains consciousness, and her arm is ultimately amputated. Twenty-five years later, Mattie receives a letter from Cogburn inviting her to attend a traveling Wild West show in which he is performing. When she finally arrives at the shows location, she is informed by Cole Younger and Frank James that Cogburn had died three days earlier. She thanks Younger, who stood and removed his hat when she approached; she calls Frank James \"trash\" since he stayed seated and didn't bother to show her any courtesy. Mattie, who never married, has Cogburn's body moved to her family cemetery in Yell County, Arkansas . She considers going to visit LaBoeuf, who is still alive, but wonders if he remains the same man or not.",

He flees but is robbed by highwaymen on his way to Dublin . Penniless, Barry enlists in the Army.

The Prussians suspect that the Chevalier de Balibari, an Austrian diplomat and professional gambler, is in fact an Irishman and a spy for Empress Maria Theresa , and assign Barry to become his manservant. An emotional Barry confides everything to the Chevalier and they become confederates. After they win an enormous sum from the Prince of Tübingen at cards, the Prince accuses the Chevalier of cheating (without proof) and refuses to pay his debt. The Chevalier  threatens to demand satisfaction . To avoid a scandal, the Ministry of Police pays off the debt and quietly escorts the Chevalier outside Prussian borders, which allows Barry, disguised as the Chevalier, to leave the country as well, the Chevalier himself having uneventfully crossed the frontier the night before.

    "plot": "Clarice Starling , a young FBI trainee at the Quantico Academy , is recruited by Behavioral Science Unit chief Jack Crawford to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter , a brilliant and cannibalistic psychiatrist imprisoned at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Under the guise of soliciting his participation in a psychological survey, Crawford secretly aims to leverage Lecter's insights to apprehend \" Buffalo Bill \", a serial killer who murders young women and removes their skin. At the hospital, Dr. Frederick Chilton , the facility's manipulative director, makes unwelcome advances toward Starling before escorting her to Lecter's cell. Initially courteous, Lecter grows dismissive upon deducing Crawford's ulterior motive. As Starling departs, inmate Miggs flings semen at her, provoking Lecter's disgust. He summons her back and offers a clue as an anagram that leads her to a storage unit containing a severed head in a jar—later revealed to belong to Benjamin Raspail, a former patient of Lecter's and whose killer is believed to be Buffalo Bill. Soon afterward, Miggs is found dead in his cell, having swallowed his own tongue—an act implicitly orchestrated by Lecter as retribution for his assault on Starling. Lecter agrees to assist the investigation in exchange for a transfer away from Chilton. Meanwhile, another victim is discovered with a death's-head moth lodged in her throat—the same species later found inside the severed head. When Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin, Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fraudulent deal: a prison transfer in return for actionable intelligence. Lecter instead demands a quid pro quo , extracting personal details from Starling. She reveals that her father, a police officer, was murdered when she was ten, leaving her orphaned. In exchange, Lecter reveals that Buffalo Bill is not a genuine transsexual but mistakenly believes that he is, possibly having been rejected from gender-reassignment clinics due to psychological instability. Unbeknownst to Starling, Chilton records the conversation and later exposes her deceit, offering Lecter a new arrangement: relocation to Tennessee in exchange for information. Lecter complies and is flown to Memphis , where he provides Senator Martin with accurate details about Buffalo Bill's appearance but falsely identifies him as \"Louis Friend\". Starling deciphers \"Louis Friend\" as an anagram for \" iron sulfide \" (fool's gold) and confronts Lecter in his temporary cell at a Memphis courthouse. Lecter demands deeper revelations, offering a final cryptic clue—\"we covet what we see every day\"—before Starling, compelled by his probing, recounts a traumatic childhood incident: after her father's death, she lived on a relative's Montana farm, where she failed to save spring lambs from slaughter. Lecter intuits that saving Catherine might silence this trauma and, satisfied, returns the Buffalo Bill case files. That night, Lecter orchestrates a gruesome escape by using a piece of Chilton's pen to unlock his restraints and murder his two guards. He later peels the face off one of the guards and wears it as a disguise, fooling paramedics into wheeling him out of the building. Analyzing Lecter's annotations, Starling deduces that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim, Frederika Bimmel, a tailor from Ohio , and independently follows the lead. At Bimmel's home, she finds unfinished dresses and patterns matching patches of skin removed from the victims, realizing that Bill seeks to construct a \"suit\" from human flesh and that he starves his captives to loosen their skin. Crawford cross-references Lecter's profile with records from sex-reassignment clinics and offender databases to identify Jame Gumb as the prime suspect. While Crawford's team raids Gumb's vacant Illinois residence, Starling interviews Bimmel's acquaintances, arriving at a house where Gumb poses as \"Jack Gordon\". His façade crumbles when Starling spots a death's-head moth. Pursuing Gumb into his basement, Starling discovers Catherine trapped in a dry well. Gumb stalks her using night-vision goggles but betrays his position by cocking his revolver. Starling fires blindly, killing him. Catherine is rescued, and Starling graduates from the FBI Academy. During her graduation celebration, Lecter calls from an unnamed tropical location, asking Starling if \"the lambs have stopped screaming.\" He assures her he has no intention of pursuing her, requesting that she return the favor—a vow she declines.

    "plot": "In 1890, well-known widowed matchmaker Dolly Levi plans to travel to Yonkers, New York . She seeks a wife for Horace Vandergelder, an unmarried \"half-a-millionaire\". Meanwhile, young artist Ambrose Kemper wants to marry Horace's niece Ermengarde. Horace opposes this, feeling that Ambrose cannot provide financial security. Horace, who owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed, plans to travel to New York City to march in the 14th Street Parade and to propose to milliner Irene Molloy, whom he met through Dolly. After arriving in Yonkers, Dolly sends Horace ahead to New York. Before leaving, he tells his clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, to mind the store. Cornelius, however, decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers. Dolly overhears and decides to set them up with Irene and her shop assistant Minnie Fay. Dolly also helps Ambrose and Ermengarde, entering them in a dance contest at the fancy Harmonia Gardens restaurant, which she and her late husband Ephram frequented. The entire company takes the train to New York. In New York, Irene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon. Irene does not love Horace, but the marriage can provide her with financial security and an escape from her boring job. Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop, pretending to be rich. When Horace and Dolly arrive, Cornelius and Barnaby hide. Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in an armoire. Horace is about to open the armoire, but Dolly \"searches\" it and pronounces it empty. After hearing Cornelius sneeze, Horace storms out, realizing that there are men hiding in the shop but unaware that they are his clerks. Dolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies to dinner at Harmonia Gardens, to make up for their humiliation. The clerks and the ladies attend the Fourteenth Street Association Parade. In a moment alone, Dolly asks for her late husband Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign. She resolves to go forward with life. After meeting old friend Gussie Granger on a parade float, Dolly catches up with the annoyed Horace, who is marching in the parade. She says that the heiress Ernestina Simple would be a good match for him and requests that he meet her that evening at Harmonia Gardens. Because the clerks have no money to hire a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant is more stylish. At the Harmonia Gardens restaurant, head waiter Rudolph prepares his crew for Dolly's return. Horace arrives to meet his date, who is really Gussie. She is neither rich nor elegant as Dolly implied, and leaves after being bored by Horace, as she and Dolly had planned. Cornelius, Barnaby and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also there. Dolly shows up and is greeted by the staff. She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table, and says that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Fearful of being caught, Cornelius confesses to the ladies that he and Barnaby are not wealthy. Irene, who knew all along that they were pretending, offers to pay for the meal. However, Irene realizes that she left her handbag containing all her money at home. The four try to sneak out during the polka contest, but Horace recognizes them, then spots Ermengarde and Ambrose. In the ensuing confrontation, Horace fires the clerks, who are forced to flee as a riot breaks out. Cornelius professes his love for Irene. Horace declares that he would not marry Dolly if she were the last woman on earth. The next morning, at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde all come to collect the money that Horace owes to them. Chastened, Horace admits that he needs Dolly, who is unsure about the marriage until Ephram sends her a sign. Cornelius becomes Horace's business partner at the store, and Barnaby fills Cornelius's old position. Horace says that life would be dull without Dolly, and she promises that she will \"never go away again\".",

    "plot": "Hal Philip Walker, Replacement Party candidate in the 1976 United States presidential election , arrives in Nashville for a fundraising gala. Meanwhile, two recording sessions are taking place in a nearby studio: in one room, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the Bicentennial , while next door, Linnea Reese, a white gospel singer, records a song with the Jubilee Singers of historically black Fisk University . Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company), attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital). She is greeted at Berry Field by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen groupie going by the name \"L.A. Joan\", is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer. On the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion , and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic, demonstrating no singing ability, but leading to her recruitment as entertainment for Walker's fundraiser. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea a few weeks earlier, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry . Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown, angrily establishing his dominance. On Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings \"In the Garden\" from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs. After Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives an initially strong performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to open his violin case. At the Exit/In club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \" I'm Easy \" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom's room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to Detroit with him; she refuses, determined to \"sing with Barbara Jean\". The next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set on stage, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. Barbara Jean is shot; a bullet grazes Haven's arm. Chaos breaks out. Kelly disarms Kenny. Barbara Jean is carried off the stage, bleeding profusely. Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \" This isn't Dallas .” Being wounded, he gives over the mike to Winifred, who haltingly then more strongly begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", eventually joined by Linnea's gospel choir also on stage.",

    "plot": "In 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the Lord Chamberlain's Men and playwright for Philip Henslowe , owner of The Rose Theatre . Suffering from writer's block with a new comedy, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter , Shakespeare attempts to seduce Rosaline, mistress of Richard Burbage , owner of the rival Curtain Theatre , and to convince Burbage to buy the play from Henslowe. Shakespeare receives advice from friend and rival playwright Christopher Marlowe , but is despondent to learn Rosaline is sleeping with Master of the Revels Edmund Tilney . The desperate Henslowe, in debt to ruthless moneylender Fennyman, begins auditions anyway. Viola de Lesseps, daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare's plays at court, disguises herself as a man named Thomas Kent to audition. Kent gains Shakespeare's interest with a speech from Two Gentlemen of Verona , but runs away when Shakespeare questions her. He pursues Kent to Viola's house and leaves a note with her nurse, asking Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose. Shakespeare sneaks into a ball at the house, where Viola's parents arrange her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an aristocrat in need of money. Dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless. Confronted by Wessex, Shakespeare introduces himself as Christopher Marlowe. Wessex ejects \"Marlowe\" and threatens to kill him. Shakespeare finds Viola on her balcony, where they confess their mutual attraction before he is discovered by her nurse and flees. Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare quickly transforms the play into what will become Romeo and Juliet . Rehearsals begin, with Thomas Kent as Romeo, the leading tragedian Ned Alleyn as Mercutio, and the stagestruck Fennyman in a small role. After Shakespeare discovers Viola's true identity, they begin a secret affair. Viola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Wessex. Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her nurse's female cousin, and anonymously persuades Wessex in public to wager £50 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men. Queen Elizabeth I declares that she will judge the matter. Burbage learns Shakespeare has seduced Rosaline and cheated him out of payment for the play, and starts a brawl at the Rose with his company. The Rose players repel Burbage and his men and celebrate at the pub, where a drunken Henslowe lets slip to Viola that Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife. News arrives that Marlowe has been murdered. A guilt-ridden Shakespeare assumes Wessex had Marlowe killed, believing him to be Viola's lover, while Viola believes Shakespeare to be the victim. Shakespeare appears at her church, allaying Viola's fears and terrifying Wessex, who believes he is a ghost. Viola confesses her love for Shakespeare, but both recognize she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex. John Webster , an unpleasant boy who hangs around the theatre, spies on Shakespeare and Viola making love and informs Tilney, who closes the Rose for breaking the ban on women actors. Viola's identity is exposed, leaving Shakespeare without a stage or a lead actor, until Burbage offers his theatre and the heartbroken Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo. Following her wedding, Viola learns the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain. She overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, his voice having broken , and Henslowe asks her to replace him. She plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo to an enthralled audience. Just after the play has concluded, Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola's presence, but the Queen reveals herself in attendance and restrains him, pretending that Kent is a man with a \"remarkable resemblance\" to a woman. Powerless to end a lawful marriage, she orders Viola to sail with Wessex to Virginia . The Queen also tells Wessex, whom Webster reveals has followed Viola to the theatre, that Romeo and Juliet has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his £50 to Shakespeare with instructions to write \"something more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night \". Viola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalize her, as he imagines the beginning of Twelfth Night , in character as a castaway disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.",

Her partial remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes it was a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody plans to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until young Alex Kintner is killed at a crowded beach. A $3,000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming she was killed by an unusually large shark. When local fishermen catch a tiger shark , Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes the killer shark is still active. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull and finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He drops the tooth after encountering Gardner's severed head. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody's son, Michael, who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint. Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, and Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat, the Orca , to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls it underwater and disappears. At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo; he reveals that during World War II , he survived the sinking of the USS Indianapolis , during which sharks killed many U.S. sailors. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint speeds the Orca toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine fails. As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage , intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody thrusts a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.",

One year earlier, Neff flirts with Phyllis Dietrichson during a house call about her husband's automobile insurance. Phyllis asks about getting a policy on Mr. Dietrichson's life without his knowledge. Deducing that she is contemplating murder, Neff wants no part of it but is fascinated with her and struggles with temptation to use his knowledge to outsmart the insurance company. Later, Phyllis visits his apartment, where Neff concocts a plan to have Dietrichson sign a life insurance policy without realizing it, murder him, and frame it as an accident to trigger the policy's double indemnity clause with a higher payout. Dietrichson signs the policy slipped in as a “copy” of his automotive insurance renewal. Before the murder can take place, Dietrichson unexpectedly breaks his leg, delaying and complicating the scheme. Neff hides in the back seat of Phyllis' car while she drives Dietrichson to a train station. Neff breaks Dietrichson's neck, leaving the dead body in the car with Phyllis, while he boards the train posing as Dietrichson, with a fake plaster cast on his leg. A helpful passenger almost foils the plan, requiring Neff to keep his hat pulled low and face averted; to vacate the observation car, Neff sends him on an errand for cigars. Neff jumps off the train at a pre-arranged spot, where Phyllis helps him stage Dietrichson's body on the tracks. Neff's boss believes Dietrichson's death a suicide . Keyes, a dogged claims manager proud of his track record in spotting fraud, nevertheless scoffs at the idea he considers statistically implausible. Keyes does find it strange that Dietrichson did not file a claim after breaking his leg. He begins to suspect that Phyllis and an accomplice murdered Dietrichson. Reasoning that Dietrichson was unaware of the policy, Keyes questions Neff, the salesman, who affirms that Dietrichson signed the policy. Based on 11 years of respect and friendship, the ordinarily suspicious Keyes does not question Neff's account. Meanwhile, Neff befriends Phyllis' stepdaughter, Lola, who has a resentful boyfriend named Nino Zachetti, a medical school dropout for lack of funds. Lola tells Neff that she saw Phyllis trying on mourning clothes several days before Dietrichson's death and that she believes Phyllis, her mother's nurse during an illness, had killed her mother to marry Dietrichson. Lola now fears that Phyllis plans to kill her next for the money. Neff now begins to see the extent of Phyllis's manipulations. Keyes finds the witness from the train's observation car who says that the man he saw on the train was not the Dietrichson in photos, but fails to recognize Neff, who is present. Neff warns Phyllis that pursuing the insurance claim in court risks exposing the murder, and insists that they should not see each other until the investigation ends. Nino Zachetti has been visiting Phyllis every night since the murder, and Keyes now suspects Nino is her accomplice. Suspecting that Phyllis is now manipulating Nino to eliminate him and kill Lola, Neff confronts Phyllis and threatens to kill her. Phyllis shoots Neff, but when he comes closer and dares her to shoot again, she does not. She says that she never loved him \"until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot.\" As they embrace, Neff shoots her twice with her gun. As Neff leaves, he sees Nino walking up to the house. Neff convinces Nino to call Lola and make up with her. Finishing recording his confession, Neff looks up to see Keyes, summoned by a janitor who saw blood drippings. When Neff asks how long Keyes has been listening, Keyes responds “Long enough.” Asking for a head start, Neff intends to flee to Mexico, but Keyes says he won't make it to the elevator. Neff collapses in the doorway as Keyes calls for an ambulance and the police, and the two wait for them to arrive. Chuckling ruefully, Neff says that Keyes couldn't solve this one because the culprit was too close, right across the desk. Keyes responds, “Closer than that, Walter.” Walter responds, “I love you, too.”",

Although it lies beyond the levee system that helps protect the land to the north from rising sea levels, Wink thinks it is the most beautiful place in the world and looks down on the way people live on the other side of the levee. In a rustic community schoolhouse, Miss Bathsheba teaches the children of the Bathtub about prehistoric creatures called aurochs (portrayed as giant horned boar-like creatures in the film rather than wild cattle) that terrorized cavemen and ate their children. She says the cavemen did not bemoan their fate, however, and the students should remember this lesson and learn how to survive, since the fabric of the universe will soon come \"unraveled\", causing the ice caps to melt and the Bathtub to end up underwater. At home, Hushpuppy finds Wink has gone missing, so she fends for herself. When he returns, he is wearing a hospital gown and bracelet. They argue, and he tells Hushpuppy to leave him alone. She returns to her house, which is a separate building from the one in which Wink resides, and finds her food burning on the stove. She turns up the heat, which sets her house on fire and draws Wink's attention. A chase ensues between the two, and she ends up getting slapped by Wink. When she retaliates by punching him in the chest, he collapses. At the same moment, there is a rumble of thunder. Hushpuppy thinks she has thrown off the balance of the Universe by striking her father and runs to get help. Miss Bathsheba gives her some herbal medicine , but when Hushpuppy gets back home Wink is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, Hushpuppy imagines that the ice calving releases some aurochs that have been frozen in polar ice into the ocean. Throughout the rest of the film, they are seen to reach land, break out of the ice that encases them, and make their way toward the Bathtub. As the weather worsens and Hushpuppy watches many residents of the Bathtub fleeing the impending flood, she sees Wink staggering along the side of the road. He finds some friends and encourages them to ride out the storm before taking Hushpuppy home to do the same. The Bathtub floods overnight, and the next day Wink and Hushpuppy tour the devastation and reconnect with the handful of their neighbors who have also stayed behind. The remaining Bathtub residents build floating homes and make plans to rebuild their community. Some of them think the flooding is only temporary, but Miss Bathsheba thinks it is permanent and says the amount of time before they will have to move is limited. As time passes, it seems likely that she is right, so Wink hatches a plan to drain the water away by blowing a hole in the levee with an alligator gar carcass stuffed with explosives. The water recedes, but then authorities arrive to enforce a mandatory evacuation of the Bathtub. They remove the remaining residents to an emergency shelter and Wink undergoes an operation for his ailment against his wishes. It has come too late to restore his health, however, and he tries to send Hushpuppy to be raised by someone else, but she refuses to go. At the first opportunity, the evacuees escape back to their homes. While Wink lies dying, Hushpuppy and a few of her friends attempt to swim to a flashing light across the water that she feels might lead her to her absent mother. They are picked up by a boat that takes them to a floating bar known as the Elysian Fields . Hushpuppy thinks that the cook is her mother, though the woman doesn't recognize her. The cook says Hushpuppy can stay with her if she wants, but Hushpuppy says she needs to go home. Hushpuppy gets back to the Bathtub just as the aurochs are also arriving. Her friends run away, but she calmly stands her ground and confronts the aurochs. She convinces them to leave and goes to be with Wink.

    "plot": "Charlie Babbitt is an arrogant collectibles dealer in the middle of importing four grey market Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale. He needs to deliver the cars to impatient buyers who have already made down payments to repay the loan he took out to buy them, but the EPA is holding the cars at the port because they have failed emission tests . Charlie directs an employee to lie to the buyers while he stalls his creditor. When Charlie learns that his estranged father Sanford Babbitt has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to Cincinnati to settle the estate. He inherits only a group of rosebushes and a classic 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible over which he and Sanford had clashed, while the remainder of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed trustee . He learns that the money is being directed to a local mental institution , where he meets his elder brother Raymond, of whom he was unaware. Raymond is an autistic savant and follows strict routines. He has superb recall , but he shows little emotional expression, except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Disheartened with the way Charlie treats Raymond, Susanna leaves him. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but Dr. Bruner refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of Raymond to get control of the money. After Raymond refuses to fly to Los Angeles, he and Charlie resort to driving there instead. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on following his routines, which include watching The People's Court on television every day, getting to bed by 11:00 p.m., and refusing to travel when it rains. He also objects to traveling on the Interstate after they encounter a car accident. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including his ability to instantly perform complex calculations and count hundreds of objects at once , far beyond the typical range of human abilities. He also realizes that Raymond had lived with the family as a child and was the \"Rain Man\" (Charlie's infantile pronunciation of \"Raymond\"), a comforting figure Charlie had remembered as an imaginary friend. Raymond had saved an infant Charlie from being scalded by hot bathwater one day, but Sanford blamed Raymond for nearly injuring Charlie, and committed him to the institution, as he was unable to speak up for himself and correct the misunderstanding. Charlie's creditor repossesses the Lamborghinis, forcing him to refund his buyers' down payments and leaving him deeply in debt. Having passed Las Vegas , he and Raymond return to Caesars Palace and devise a plan to win the needed money by playing blackjack and counting cards with Raymond's abilities. Although the casino bosses obtain videotape evidence of the scheme and ask them to leave, Charlie successfully wins $86,000 to cover his debts. He also reconciles with Susanna, who has rejoined the brothers in Las Vegas. Returning to Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses, saying he is no longer upset about being cut out of Sanford's will, but he wants to have a relationship with Raymond. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond proves to be unable to decide for himself what he wants . Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother. As Raymond and Dr. Bruner board a train to return to the institution, Charlie promises to visit in two weeks.",

When owner Bernard Hinchecliffe plans to boost sales with a retrospective series on a 20-year-old murder, hoping to revive the scandal, Randall reluctantly agrees. He had covered the original story about stenographer Nancy Voorhees, who shot her boss after he reneged on his promise to marry her. Her pregnancy won the jury's sympathy, and she was acquitted. Unaware of impending doom, Nancy is now married to Michael Townsend, an upstanding member of society, and her daughter Jenny, who believes that Townsend is her father, is about to marry the son of a socially prominent family, Philip Weeks. Randall throws himself into the assignment. To dig up dirt about Nancy, he assigns unscrupulous reporter \"Reverend\" T. Vernon Isopod, who masquerades as a minister and wins the confidence of the bride's parents on the eve of the wedding. They have read the headlines promising a series on the murder. Nancy is horrified at the renewed interest in the scandal, and the family members confess their concerns to Isopod, whom they mistake for a church representative, and give him a photo of Jenny. Michael realizes the horrible mistake just as Isopod leaves, and he phones the church. Randall's secretary Miss Taylor is so disgusted that she gets drunk at a local speakeasy and then tells Randall what she thinks of the whole affair. Isopod comes in late, drunk and brimming with information. Randall swings into action, mocking up a photo layout. Randall sends reporters Ziggie and Carmody to cover the Townsend apartment. The Townsends, hoping to prevent the revelation of the full story and save the marriage,  make separate appeals for help. Mr. Townsend visits the church rector , who promises support, and Nancy phones Randall, begging him to drop the story, but he refuses, telling her that it is too late. Nancy kills herself by taking poison, and Michael comes home and discovers her body in the bathroom.

Randall opposes the idea. Jenny visits the paper and demands that the men tell her why they killed her mother. A guilt-ridden and disgusted Randall tells her that they were killed for the purpose of circulation. Jenny points a gun at Randall but Philip appears just in time to prevent her from pulling the trigger. Phillip then angrily delivers a chilling speech that ends: \"You've grown rich on filth and no one's ever dared rise up and crush you out.\" He threatens to hunt them down and kill them if his wife's name is ever mentioned in the paper again. Randall denounces Hinchecliffe and resigns. He runs out and Miss Taylor follows him.

At a family wedding, Charley is quickly infatuated with a beautiful non-Italian woman he doesn't recognize. He asks Maerose Prizzi, estranged daughter of Dominic, if she recognizes the woman, oblivious to the fact that Maerose still has feelings for Charley, having once been his lover. Maerose is in disfavor with her father for running off with another man before the end of her romance with Charley. Charley flies to California to carry out a contract to kill a man named Marxie Heller for robbing a Nevada casino. He is surprised to learn that Marxie is the estranged husband of Irene Walker, the woman from the wedding. She repays some of the money Marxie stole as Charley naively (or willfully) believes that Irene was not involved with the casino scam. By this point they have fallen in love and eventually travel to Mexico to marry. A jealous Maerose travels west on her own to establish for a fact that Irene has double-crossed the organization. The information restores Maerose to good graces somewhat with her father and the don. Charley's father later reveals that Irene (who had claimed to be a tax consultant) is a \"contractor\" who, like Charley, performs assassinations for the mob. Dominic, acting on his own, wants Charley out of the way and hires someone to do the hit, not knowing that he has just given the job to Charley's own wife. Angelo sides with his son, and Eduardo is so appalled by his brother's actions that he helps set up Dominic's permanent removal from the family.

It will require all his savings, plus a mortgage, but he can hardly contain his excitement. Joyce informs him of the true cost of the letter, which Robert insists on reading. He is devastated to learn that Leslie had lied about the killing and had been unfaithful with Hammond for years. As a party celebrating the acquittal gets underway, Leslie discovers a dagger on her porch which she recognizes from the shop where she retrieved the letter. Immediately aware of the implication, she nevertheless joins the party before retreating to her room to lose herself in her lacework. Robert brags to his friends about his Sumatran fantasy, but collapses in gin and misery. Robert offers to forgive Leslie if she can swear her love to him. She does, but then abruptly confesses that she still loves Hammond. Robert rushes from the room. Opening the door to the garden, Leslie sees the dagger is now gone. She recognizes the inevitability of her fate, and ghosts down the garden path toward it. Outside the gate, Leslie is grabbed from behind and held by her own manservant while Hammond's widow stabs her with the dagger. The two murderers attempt to slip away, but are stopped within steps by the flashlight of a policeman, who leads them silently away.",

    "plot": "In the late 1930s, the governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert \"Happy\" Hopper, appoints Jefferson Smith to replace deceased U.S. Senator Sam Foley. Smith is head of the Boy Rangers, and his appointment is supported by the governor's children. Corrupt political boss Jim Taylor sought the appointment of his handpicked stooge, while popular committees wanted another candidate. Smith, however, was chosen because his naivety about politics was expected to make him easy to manipulate. Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine, who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan. At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's naïve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front-page pictures and headlines branding him a yokel . To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders, who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building graft scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor political machine and supported by Senator Paine. Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Paine then advises Smith to keep silent about the matter. The following day, when Smith speaks out about the bill at Senate, the machine in his state — through Paine — accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked and angry by Paine's betrayal to defend himself and runs away. Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a filibuster to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 25 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the dam scheme's true motives. Yet none of the senators are convinced. The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. The Boy Rangers' effort to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's gangsters. Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate . Smith vows to press on until people believe him but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with the pangs of remorse, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide by gunshot but is stopped by onlooking senators. He then bursts back into the Senate chamber, shouting a confession to the whole scheme; the reformed Paine further insists that he must be expelled from the Senate and affirms Smith's innocence to Clarissa's delight.

    "plot": "An idealistic young medical student, Martin Arrowsmith, introduces himself assertively to Dr. Max Gottlieb, a noted bacteriologist. Though Gottlieb deems Arrowsmith not yet ready to study with him, he is impressed by the young man's determination and honest self-appraisal, and encourages him to take the standard course of study first. When Arrowsmith graduates, Gottlieb offers him a position as his research assistant, but the young man reluctantly turns him down, having fallen in love with a nurse, Leora. He would be unable to support her on a research assistant's meager salary. He marries, and the couple sets off for Leora's rural home town in South Dakota. Unhappy with the vicissitudes of his medical practice there, he is drawn by a former client across the boundary into veterinary medicine when the man's cows are dying - even faster when given injections by the local state health official.  Determined to find a cure of his own, he carries out scientific research in his kitchen, eventually developing a successful serum. Reinvigorated, he decides to abandon his practice and join Gottlieb as a research scientist at the renowned and extremely well-funded McGurk Institute in New York. Meanwhile, Leora miscarries and cannot have any more children, so she devotes herself to her husband's career. After two fallow years at McGurk, Arrowsmith stumbles onto an antibiotic serum that he does not understand (and is unsure how he produced), yet has demonstrated the ability to kill at least one type of germ.  He shortly is able to replicate it, and in order to study its efficacy on other microbes is sent to the West Indies , where a virulent outbreak of bubonic plague has arisen.  He is coincidentally teamed with a popular Swedish lecturer on \"Heroes of Health\" he once met while still in South Dakota, Dr. Gustav Sondelius, who is extremely enthusiastic over both the team and the serum's prospects to help cure the disease. Leora accompanies her husband, despite his fear for her safety. Arrowsmith has strict instructions from Gottlieb to employ the scientific method in his efforts, conducting a blind study by administering the serum to one-half his patients and a placebo injection to the other.  Upon learning of this, the West Indies governor, Sir Robert Fairland, refuses to allow him to proceed.  Seeking to break the impasse, black Dr. Oliver Marchand suggests Arrowsmith conduct his experiment in a backwater community on a neighboring island where the infection is rampant. Arrowsmith agrees, insisting Leora stay behind for her own protection.  The study begins.  Among those seeking an inoculation of Arrowsmith's serum is Mrs. Joyce Lanyon, a New York socialite stranded on the island. They are attracted to each other, though their subsequent affair is only hinted at obliquely. Sondelius contracts the disease.  In his death throes, he pleads with Arrowsmith to abandon scientific protocol and save as many lives as possible. Concerned about his wife's welfare, Arrowsmith asks Marchand to check on her upon his return to the main island, only to have his colleague die while on the phone before he can give his report.  Arrowsmith races home, but Leora is dead. In a drunken delirium, he gives the serum to all, saving the Indies from the plague. Upon his return to New York, he is hailed by the press and feted by McGurk Institute head Dr. Tubbs, who seeks to take advantage of Arrowsmith's glory. Arrowsmith instead rushes directly to Gottlieb. Desperate to explain his abandonment of research principles and his mentor's specific mandate to advance science rather than practice medicine, Arrowsmith discovers that Gottlieb has had a stroke, is insensible, and near death.  Disgusted with all that is transpiring, friend and colleague Terry Wickett, a prominent chemist at the Institute, announces abruptly that he is quitting to set up his own \"shoestring\" laboratory to pursue science.  Turning his back on public adulation, a promotion, and a big raise, Arrowsmith resigns to join forces with Wickett. Joyce Lanyon appears, seeking to rekindle their relationship, but he spurns her, committing himself to his career.",

    "name": "Norma Rae",
    "plot": "Norma Rae Wilson is a worker in a cotton mill that has taken too much of a toll on her family's health for her to ignore their poor working conditions. She is also a single mother with two children by different fathers, one dead and the other negligent, and frequently has flings with other men to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. Initially, management tries to divert her frequent protests by promoting her to \"spot checker\", where she is responsible for ensuring other workers are fulfilling work quotas. She reluctantly takes the job for the pay hike, but when fellow employees, including her father, shun her for effectively being a \"fink\" to the bosses, she demands to be fired. Instead, she is demoted back to the line. Two men enter her life, and that changes her perspective. A former co-worker, Sonny Webster, asks her out after causing trouble for her at the mill. Divorced with a daughter, he proposes marriage after a short courtship; recognizing how long it has been since she met a non-selfish man with whom to keep company, she accepts his offer. After a few charged encounters with Reuben Warshowsky, a union organizer from New York City, Norma Rae listens to him deliver a speech that spurs her to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes conflict when Sonny observes she's not spending enough time at home and is frequently exhausted when she is present. When her father drops dead at the mill of a heart attack—a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of waiting for his allotted break—she is more determined to continue the fight. Management retaliates against the unionization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands Norma copy down the racist flier word for word to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management tries to stop her, then fires her on the grounds of creating a disturbance and calls the police to remove her from the mill. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word \"UNION\" on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room.  The other workers stop their mill machines one by one, and eventually, the room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben. Upon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and her recent arrest so they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no but acknowledges, \"he's in my head.\" Sonny, in turn, tells her there's no other woman in his head, and he will always remain with her. An election to unionize the factory occurs. Norma and Reuben listen as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference of just 100 votes, the union wins. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite being smitten with her, they shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.",

That night, Winifred's strict and ambitious husband George returns home from his job at the bank and places a newspaper advertisement for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kind, sympathetic nanny, but George rips their letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace. A strong wind draws the scraps up through the chimney and into the sky. The next day, several sour-faced nannies await outside the Banks family's home, but a strong gust of wind magically blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young woman floating down from the sky, gracefully descending with an open umbrella. The woman enters the Banks family's home and introduces herself as Mary Poppins . To George's shock, Mary is holding the children's advertisement, and the scraps have been put back together. She agrees with the advertisement's requests, but promises George that she will be firm with his children. Mary manipulates George into hiring her.

While putting the children to bed, Mary sings a lullaby. The next day, the trio and Bert visit Mary's odd uncle, Albert, whose uncontrollable laughter has caused him to float.

That evening, Mary sings a lullaby about a woman who sells bird food on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral . The next day at the bank, the children meet George's boss, the elderly Mr. Dawes Sr., who advises Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching the coins out of Michael's hand.

Bert advises George to spend more time with Jane and Michael before they grow up. Hoping to make amends, Michael gives George the tuppence. Stricken with regret, George slowly walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering . Lost for words, George exclaims \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", tells a joke Albert had told the children, and happily walks home. When Mr. Dawes Sr. understands the joke, he floats up into the air, laughing. The next day, Mary Poppins tells the children she must leave. George mends his children's kite and takes the family out to fly it. At the park, the family encounters Mr. Dawes Sr.'s son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals that his father died laughing at the joke.

    "plot": "The ship's medical officer, Dr. Schumann, takes a special interest in La Condesa , a Spanish countess with an opiate addiction, being deported from Cuba to a Spanish prison in Tenerife for illegally aiding agitators . The 600 field workers in steerage , being deported to Spain due to the low market price of Cuban sugar , cheer the Condesa as she boards the ship under police escort. The Condesa tells the doctor she was motivated by seeing the impoverished conditions in which 5,000 laborers lived, under patronage of the man with whom she lived in luxury. She manipulates the doctor for drugs , but her activism aligns with the doctor's humanitarian ideals that the laborers in steerage be treated like human beings rather than cargo. Their shared sympathies soon evolve into love, though both realize it is a hopeless situation. The doctor conceals having a heart condition. Selected passengers—mostly Aryan Germans—are invited to dine each night at the captain's table. Some are amused and others offended by the anti-Jewish rants of a German businessman, Rieber, who begins an affair with Lizzi, a statuesque blonde, who admires him for his vitality and mind, until she learns he is married. Austrian-born Rieber extols the virtues of German nationalism and eugenics . The captain is reassured by Rieber's rants, believing that nobody can ever take the Nazi party seriously. Though Jews and a dwarf are excluded from the table, the Hutten’s dog, Baby , is allowed. When Baby is thrown overboard by children from steerage, the dog is saved, but an animal-loving laborer drowns in the rescue, despite the doctor's ministrations. The Huttens fuss over the dog, oblivious that its rescuer has died, even when informed by the doctor. The Jewish Lowenthal is seated at a side table with a dwarf named Glocken, and the two bond over their social exclusion . Later Freytag, a German passenger, is moved to this table when Rieber learns Freytag's wife is Jewish. Eventually Freytag discloses that he is separated from his Jewish wife due to pressure from his family and his employer. \nRevealing his Iron Cross 2nd class he earned in World War I , Lowenthal discusses with Glocken what it means to be German, including the Nazi party and its anti-Jewish sentiment , which Lowenthal hopes to be temporary saying Jews have been good for Germany. Lowenthal is ultimately positive about the future of Jews in Germany, while Glocken is diametrically opposed in his pessimism. Glocken tells Lowenthal that he may be the biggest fool on the ship. An American artist couple, David and Jenny, have a passionate but tumultuous relationship. David is disconsolate at his lack of success as a socially committed artist; the independent Jenny dislikes his \"unsellable\" art and does not wish to compete with it in the relationship. He is dismissive of her artistic talent, which she herself undervalues. David expresses that whoever shares his life will need to accept that his art will always supersede her. Jenny fears that their life together will be endlessly fighting, with neither willing to put the other's needs before their own. Passengers are entertained nightly by a troupe of flamenco musicians and dancers, whose leader pimps the women in the troupe. Johann, an unpaid caregiver to Herr Graf, his invalid uncle, ignores the wholesome and insecure Elsa, who is traveling with her parents. Instead, Johann is attracted to one of the dancers, who rejects him for inability to pay. Johann threatens his stingy uncle if he does not give him money which has been promised to him in his uncle's will. He loses his virginity to one of the dancers, who treats him with gentleness when he pays. Mary Treadwell, a divorced fading beauty hoping to recapture her youth in Paris, is too mature to interest the captain. She disdains the lieutenant who shows interest, dismissing him first as doing his duty to unattended women and later as insignificant. When former baseball player and fellow American Bill Tenny is seated at her table, she finds him crass and ignorant. Tenny expresses surprise at the open hostility toward the Jews onboard; she sarcastically replies that maybe he was too busy \"lynching Negroes\" to focus on Jews. Tenny pesters one of the flamenco dancers, believing that buying a magnum of champagne entitles him to her favors . She gives him the cabin number of Mrs. Treadwell. In a drunken stupor, Tenny barges into the cabin and accosts Mrs. Treadwell, who momentarily responds passionately until she realizes that he has mistaken her for a prostitute; she then hits him repeatedly and expels him from the cabin. The ship arrives in Tenerife, where the deported workers from steerage disembark. The doctor briefly considers staying with the Condesa, but the captain calls him foolish, contending that the Condesa manipulated him for drugs. After an emotionally painful farewell with the doctor, the Condesa is forced to exit the ship under Civil Guard escort. When the captain tells the distraught doctor she is not worth his anguish, the doctor explodes in a fit of pique, throwing cognac in his face and rebuking him, expressing that the Condesa took action against injustice, while they just carry out the orders they are given. Apologetic, the captain advises the doctor that he looks ill and should not respond to a call from a passenger for medical attention. The doctor ignores this and dies of a heart attack.

Years pass and Pollard becomes a jockey, but amateur boxing leaves him blind in one eye. After their young son is killed in an automobile accident, Howard's wife leaves him. He obtains a divorce in Mexico, where Pollard is struggling to make his mark as a jockey. Howard meets and marries Marcela Zabala. When he acquires a stable of racehorses, he hires itinerant horseman Tom Smith as his trainer. Smith convinces him to buy a colt called Seabiscuit . Though a grandson of the great Man o' War and trained by the renowned James E. Fitzsimmons , Seabiscuit is viewed as small, lazy, and unmanageable. Smith witnesses Pollard's similarly temperamental spirit, and hires him as Seabiscuit's jockey. Under Smith's innovative training, Seabiscuit becomes the most successful racehorse on the West Coast and an underdog hero to the public. Howard issues a challenge to Samuel D. Riddle , owner of the East Coast champion and Triple Crown -winning racehorse War Admiral , but Riddle dismisses California racing as inferior. In the prestigious Santa Anita Handicap , Seabiscuit takes the lead, but Pollard's impaired vision prevents him from noticing another horse surging up on the outside. Losing by a nose, Pollard admits his partial blindness to Smith. Howard declares that Pollard will remain Seabiscuit's jockey, and rallies public support for a match race with War Admiral. Riddle agrees, on the condition that they race with a rope and bell instead of a starting gate . With Seabiscuit at a disadvantage, Smith trains the horse to break fast at the sound of the bell. As the race approaches, Pollard severely fractures his leg in a riding accident. Informed he may never walk again, let alone ride, he recommends that his friend and skilled jockey George Woolf ride Seabiscuit, advising him on the horse's handling and behavior from his hospital bed. The highly anticipated \"race of the century\" draws a sellout crowd, with 40 million more people listening on the radio. Seabiscuit takes an early lead until nearing the far turn; following Pollard's advice, Woolf slows Seabiscuit, allowing War Admiral to match Seabicuit's stride. Seabiscuit looks War Admiral in the eye before surging ahead and winning by four lengths, enthralling the nation. A few months later, Seabiscuit injures his leg. Pollard, still recovering from his own injury, tends to the horse as they both heal. When Seabiscuit is fit enough to race again, Howard brings him back to the Santa Anita Handicap; he is reluctant to allow Pollard to ride and risk crippling himself for life. At the urging of Woolf and Marcela, Howard relents. Pollard, using a self-made leg brace, discovers Woolf is also in the race on a new mount. Seabiscuit drops far behind the field; Wolfe slows and pulls alongside Pollard, allowing Seabiscuit a good look at Woolf's mount. With Woolf's encouragement, Seabiscuit surges ahead. Heading for the finish line several lengths ahead, Pollard's voiceover explains that Seabiscuit was not merely a broken-down horse that three men fixed, but that Seabiscuit fixed them and, in a way, they fixed one another.",

Arthur calls his own voicemail at the firm and says he will go public with the memo. Karen directs the operatives to take lethal action. The two break into Arthur's apartment, murder him with an injection, and make it look like suicide by drug overdose. Michael learns of Arthur's death and becomes suspicious when he discovers U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before, and that Arthur had booked a flight to New York for Anna. He finds Anna and learns that she told no one of her conversations with Arthur, yet the firm somehow knew. With help from his brother Gene, a police officer, Michael breaks into Arthur's apartment, which is sealed as a crime scene. Michael finds Arthur's dogeared copy of Realm & Conquest , which contains an illustration of a horse on a hill with barren trees, and highlighting and annotations throughout the chapter Henry mentioned. The book also contains a receipt from a photocopy shop, which Michael pockets. Two police officers soon arrive on a tip from the operatives, who have been trailing Michael. Michael is arrested, but Gene bails him out. Taking the receipt to the copy shop, Michael discovers that Arthur ordered 3,000 copies of the incriminating memo. Marty offers Michael the money he requested, but insists Michael also sign a non-disclosure agreement covering his vast knowledge of the firm and its personnel. Michael accepts the money, gives up on pursuing Arthur's lead, and pays off his restaurant debt. That night, during the events depicted at the film's opening, the operatives rig Michael's car with a bomb and follow him through Westchester. After he approaches the horses on the hill, the operatives detonate his car. Michael hides with Timmy's help. At a U-North board meeting, Karen proposes that the board approve a lawsuit settlement. Michael confronts her alone and goads her into offering him $10 million for his silence. When Karen agrees, Michael reveals he is wearing a wire , with Gene and other NYPD detectives listening. As the police move in, Michael gets into a cab and rides away.",

Northup proclaims his freedom, only to be violently beaten, tortured and raped. He is shipped to New Orleans with other slaves, who tell him he must adapt if he wants to survive in the South . Slave trader Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \"Platt,\" a runaway slave from Georgia , and sells him to plantation owner William Ford .

Tibeats and his men prepare to lynch Northup but are stopped by the overseer . Northup is left on tiptoes with the noose around his neck for hours before Ford arrives and cuts him down. Northup tells Ford that he is in fact a free man, but Ford has debts to settle and sells Northup to plantation owner Edwin Epps . Epps, unlike Ford, is abusive and sadistic to his slaves. Northup meets Patsey , a favored slave and Epps' top cotton picker . Epps regularly rapes Patsey, and his jealous wife abuses her. Cotton worms destroy Epps' crops, so he leases his slaves to neighbor Judge Turner's plantation for the season. Turner favors Northup and allows him to fiddle at a celebration and keep his earnings. Northup returns to Epps and pays white field hand and former overseer Armsby to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby takes Northup's money but betrays him. Epps questions and threatens Northup, but Northup convinces him that Armsby is lying. Northup burns the letter. Patsey is caught by Epps going to a neighboring plantation to acquire soap, as Mrs. Epps will not let her have any. Epps orders Northup to whip Patsey, which he reluctantly does, but Epps demands he strike her harder, eventually taking the whip and beating Patsey nearly to death. Enraged and regretting what he did, Northup destroys his violin. Northup begins constructing a gazebo with Canadian laborer Samuel Bass . Bass, citing his Christian faith, strongly opposes slavery and castigates Epps, earning his enmity. Northup reveals his kidnapping to Bass and asks for help sending his letter. Bass hesitates because of the risk but agrees. The local sheriff arrives, and Northup recognizes his companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in New York. As they embrace, Epps furiously protests and tries to prevent Northup from leaving but is rebuffed. Northup bids farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.

    "plot": "In the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving over the rape and murder of her teen daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, she rents three disused billboards near her home and posts on them: \" Raped While Dying \", \" And Still No Arrests? \", \" How Come, Chief Willoughby? \". Many townspeople are upset by the billboards for singling out local police chief Bill Willoughby, whose pancreatic cancer diagnosis is an open secret. Willoughby visits Mildred to persuade her to take them down, but is unsuccessful. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere. Jason Dixon, an immature, prejudiced police officer who idolizes Willoughby, unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Later at his mother's suggestion, Dixon arrests Mildred's friend Denise on trivial drug possession charges to put pressure on Mildred. Mildred's dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and accidentally coughs up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice. The billboards have further strained Mildred's relationship with her son, Robbie, and she recalls that her last interaction with Angela was an argument (during which she lashed back by saying she \"hopes she gets raped\"). Her abusive ex-cop ex-husband Charlie confronts her about the billboards and ends up revealing that, shortly before Angela's murder, he had turned down her request to come live with him. Knowing his death is imminent following the hospitalization, Willoughby spends an idyllic day with his wife, Anne, and their two daughters, then commits suicide later that night to spare his family from watching him die slowly. A distraught Dixon reacts to the news by assaulting Welby and throwing him out a second-story window. This is discovered by Abercrombie, Willoughby's replacement, who fires Dixon. Before his death, Willoughby wrote several letters, including one to Mildred. Anne delivers it, interrupting an unknown man who was menacing Mildred at work. In the letter, Willoughby tells Mildred that she was not a factor in his suicide, asserts he was dedicated to finding Angela’s killer and reveals he secretly paid to keep the billboards up another month. After the billboards are destroyed by arson , Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes to be unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is inside reading Willoughby's letter to himself, which advises him to let go of hate and embrace love if he wants to be a detective someday; he manages to escape the blaze with Angela's case file. James, an acquaintance of Mildred, happens to pass by and extinguishes Dixon's burning clothes before providing Mildred with an alibi. Dixon is put in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes. Jerome, who was part of the team that put up the billboards, brings Mildred a set of copies and helps her restore the signs. Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who menaced Mildred bragging in a bar about raping a girl in the same manner as Angela. He notes the number on the man's Idaho license plate and then scratches the man's face to get a DNA sample , passively accepting the resulting beating. Mildred is on a date with James to thank him for his help, when Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and apologizes for burning the billboards when he was drunk. Unnerved that she retaliated against the wrong target, Mildred abruptly calls off the date, but James misinterprets her decision as embarrassment to be seen with him and leaves the restaurant incensed. Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample is not a match and the man was overseas on military duty at the time of Angela's death. Dixon gives Mildred the disappointing news and, believing the man to be guilty of some other rape, the pair plan a trip to Idaho to kill him. As they set out, Mildred confesses that she set the police station on fire, which Dixon had already assumed. They both express uncertainty about their mission, but Mildred says they can decide what to do along the way.",

    "plot": "In September 1975, Howard Beale , the longtime anchor for the UBS Evening News , the flagship evening news program of the Union Broadcasting System (UBS), learns from friend and news division president Max Schumacher that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings. The following night, Beale announces to his audience that he will kill himself on next Tuesday's newscast. UBS tries to immediately fire Beale, but Schumacher intervenes so that he can have a dignified farewell. Beale promises to apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches into a rant about life being \"bullshit\". Beale's outburst causes ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, UBS executives decide to exploit the situation. When Beale's ratings soon top out, programming chief Diana Christensen reaches out to Schumacher with an offer to help \"develop\" Beale's show. He declines the professional proposal but accepts her more personal pitch; the two begin an affair. When Schumacher decides to end Beale's \"angry man\" format, Christensen persuades her boss, Frank Hackett, to slot the evening news show under the entertainment division so she can develop it. Hackett bullies UBS executives to consent and fire Schumacher. In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading viewers to shout, \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\" from their windows. He is soon hosting a new program called The Howard Beale Show , top-billed as \"the mad prophet of the airwaves\". The show becomes the most highly rated program on television, and Beale finds new celebrity preaching his angry populist message in front of a live studio audience that, on cue, chants his signature catchphrase: \"We're as mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!\" Schumacher and Christensen's romance withers as the show flourishes, but in the flush of high ratings, the two ultimately find their way back together; Schumacher separates from his wife of over 25 years for Christensen. Seeking another hit, Christensen cuts a deal with a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (ELA) for a new docudrama series, The Mao Tse-Tung Hour , for which the ELA will provide exclusive footage of their activities. Meanwhile, Beale discovers that Communications Corporation of America (CCA), the parent company of UBS, will be bought out by a larger Saudi conglomerate. He urges his audience to pressure the White House to quash the deal. This panics UBS because the network's debt load has made the merger essential for its survival. CCA chairman Arthur Jensen arranges a meeting with Beale, describing the interrelatedness of the participants in the international economy and the illusory nature of nationality distinctions. Jensen scolds Beale and persuades him to abandon his message and preach a new gospel that serves Jensen's interests. Christensen's fanatical devotion to her job and emotional emptiness ultimately drive Schumacher away, warning her that she will self-destruct if she continues on her current path. Audiences find Beale's new sermons on the dehumanization of society depressing and ratings start to slip, yet Jensen refuses to fire him. To boost the network's ratings, Christensen, Hackett and the other executives decide to hire the ELA to assassinate Beale on the air. The assassination succeeds, putting an end to The Howard Beale Show and kicking off the second season of The Mao Tse-Tung Hour .

    "plot": "In 1962 Jim Crow-era Tallahassee, Florida , young African-American Elwood Curtis appears destined for great things in the classroom. His Black teacher encourages him to think for himself, rejecting Southern textbooks' slanted view of history. However, Elwood is raised by his doting grandmother, whose father died in a prison cell under suspicious circumstances, and who worries that White society will retaliate against him if he participates in the growing Civil Rights Movement , which he does. Images of Martin Luther King , Sidney Poitier , and other civil rights icons are shown, and appear throughout the film, along with other montages, such as images of the U.S. space program. One day, Elwood is accepted into a tuition-free accelerated study program at an HBCU . While hitchhiking to campus, he is picked up by a man driving a stolen car. The police catch the man and convict Elwood of being his accomplice. Because Elwood is underage, he is sent to the Nickel Academy , a reform school . Nickel is internally segregated; White students enjoy comfortable accommodations and personal attention from staff, while Black students are housed in shabby facilities, and the school makes little attempt to educate them. Although Spencer, the White superintendent, tells the Black students that they can be released for good behavior, in practice they cannot leave until they turn eighteen, as the school makes money hiring them out as convict labor . (Spencer's wife shows Elwood some kindness, donating Pride and Prejudice and other books to the boys and allowing him to use her house's pool, but Elwood had to do free labor for her.) It is implied that some students are sexually abused. Elwood bonds with Turner, another quiet student. However, while Elwood is inspired by the non-violent and democratic ideals of the Civil Rights Movement, Turner is cynical, expects only mistreatment from society, and urges Elwood to keep his head down. Elwood is bullied and beaten by another student, but the administrators do not help him: instead, they savagely beat both students. Elwood's grandmother tries to visit him at Nickel but, on arrival, is not allowed to see him. She also scrimps and saves to hire a lawyer to appeal his conviction, but the lawyer runs away with her money, devastating Elwood. Spencer bets on Nickel's annual Black-White boxing match, but quietly executes a Black student who either refused or forgot to take a dive that Spencer told him to take. In flashforwards to 1988, the adult Elwood lives in New York City, where he runs his own moving business, and a former classmate, Chickie Pete, comes to him to remember old times and to ask him for work. Elwood does not appear to be in contact with Turner. In 2018, he is badly shaken after learning that many unmarked graves have been discovered at the old Nickel campus, and does research. Forensic evidence reveals that most of the dead students were Black. Back in the 1960s, Elwood, fed up with his mistreatment, takes his carefully kept diary of Nickel abuses and convinces a reluctant Turner to deliver it to a government inspector as an exposé. However, nothing happens, and the administrators retaliate by torturing Elwood in the school sweatbox . Turner learns that the school plans to kill Elwood and comes to rescue him. They attempt an escape, running away together on bicycles. However, pursued by a car from Nickel, they are quickly caught. Turner escapes into the woods, but Elwood is shot and killed. A montage shows that Turner safely reached Tallahassee, where he delivered the news of Elwood's death to his grandmother. He then moved North and took on Elwood's name. He marries Millie, builds a stable life, and tries to honor Elwood's legacy by embracing some of his ideals. When the government begins investigating the school, Turner decides to testify about his experiences.",

    "plot": "On a suburban street at night, a black man walks alone, talking on the phone. A car pulls up to the curb beside him; sensing trouble, the man starts to walk away. A person wearing a helmet tackles and subdues the man, drags him into the car, and drives away. Chris Washington, a black photographer, travels to upstate New York for a weekend getaway to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. On the way, they hit a deer, and Rose defends Chris when the officer asks for his ID as he was not driving. He has uncomfortable conversations with Rose's parents, Dean, a neurosurgeon , and Missy, a psychiatrist. Later, Rose's brother Jeremy arrives, and Chris observes eerie behavior from the family's black servants, Georgina and Walter. Missy tricks Chris into having a hypnotherapy session with her, using the sound of a spoon stirring in a teacup as a hypnotic trigger, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. While in a trance, Chris reveals that his mother was killed in a hit-and-run when he was a child, and he feels guilty because he waited too long to call for help. At Missy's prompting, Chris' consciousness falls into a dark void she calls the \"sunken place,\" where his body becomes temporarily paralyzed. The next morning, Chris no longer has a desire to smoke. Dozens of wealthy white guests arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together, and their remarks about Chris cause him to feel uncomfortable. Chris meets a blind art dealer, Jim Hudson, who takes an interest in his photography, and Logan King, another black man. Like Walter and Georgina, Logan behaves unnaturally, and he is married to a white woman thirty years older than him. When Chris photographs Logan, the camera flash causes Logan to become hysterical, rushing at Chris and frantically lashing out at him, telling him to \"get out.\" Logan is taken away by Dean, who later claims Logan had a seizure . The party guests appear to hold some sort of silent auction with a photo of Chris as the prize. Chris sends a photo of Logan to his friend, TSA officer Rod Williams, who recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, a missing man from Brooklyn. Chris discovers photos of Rose dating numerous black people, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her earlier claim that Chris is the first black person she has dated. He tries to leave, but Rose refuses to give him the car keys. Jeremy and Dean block the doors and Missy hypnotises Chris back to the sunken place. Chris awakens strapped to an armchair in the basement. In a video, an old man, who introduces himself as Roman Armitage, explains that his family transplants the brains of their wealthy friends into black people's bodies to acquire their desirable physical characteristics, leaving the host's consciousness trapped in the sunken place. Jim Hudson appears on the TV, explaining that he wants Chris's eyesight. Meanwhile, Rod, who has been trying to contact Chris and suspects foul play, goes to the police, but they do not believe his theory about the Armitages. Missy hypnotizes Chris again. However, it is revealed that he has blocked the trigger by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing from the armchair. Chris bludgeons Jeremy and then kills Dean (who falls and accidentally sets fire to the room) and Missy when she attacks him, before finishing off Jeremy when he attacks again. Chris tries to escape in Jeremy's Porsche but accidentally hits Georgina, who has the brain of Rose's grandmother, Marianne. Compelled by guilt over his mother's death, he picks her up to save her, but she attacks him, causing the car to crash and kill her. Rose and Walter, who has the brain of Rose's grandfather Roman, arrive to capture Chris. During a scuffle, Chris uses his phone's flash to briefly free Walter from Roman's control. Walter takes Rose's rifle, shoots her, and fatally shoots himself. Chris starts strangling Rose, but cannot bring himself to kill her. A police car arrives and Chris surrenders, with Rose believing that the police will arrest Chris and save her, but it is revealed to be Rod's TSA car. Rod picks up Chris, leaving Rose to bleed out on the side of the road.",

    "plot": "Early in World War I Professor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech to his male German students about the glory of defending the fatherland. On the brink of becoming men, the boys, led by Paul Bäumer, are moved to enlist in the army as part of the new 2nd Company. Their romantic delusions are quickly shattered during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Sergeant Himmelstoss. The new soldiers arrive at the chaotic combat zone, where they find themselves under attack by artillery even before they reach their post. Their unit is composed of older, unwelcoming veterans, and, having not eaten since morning, they pay Corporal \"Kat\" Katzinsky for a meal of stolen hog with their tobacco, alcohol, and soap. The boys' first mission with the veterans is a harrowing experience, during which one of them is killed. Another dies, his nerves frayed following several days of consistent bombardment, when he frantically tries to escape from the trenches. There are heavy losses on both sides but no ground gained after the boys' first major battle, and when 2nd Company is sent back to the field kitchens for a breather and a meal each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead. After eating they begin a semi-serious discussion about the causes of this war and of wars in general. One day Himmelstoss arrives at the front, where he is spurned because of his bad reputation. He is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed after showing himself to be a coward. Paul stabs a French soldier and becomes increasingly distraught as he spends the night trapped in a shell-hole with the slowly dying man. He tries and fails to help his enemy and begs for forgiveness. When he is able, he returns to the German lines, where he is comforted by Kat. While marching behind the lines, Paul and his good friend Albert Kropp are severely wounded by artillery fire and sent to a Catholic hospital. Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive, but he makes a miraculous recovery. His elation is tempered by the depression of Albert, whose legs had to be amputated. Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. He is shocked by how uninformed and optimistic everyone is about the state of the war. When he visits Kantorek's schoolroom he is asked to share his experiences and unexpectedly expresses hopeless disillusionment with the war to the professor and his young students, who call him a coward. Cutting his furlough short, Paul returns to the front to be with people who understand him, only to find 2nd Company filled with new recruits who are even younger than he and his classmates were when they enlisted. The only familiar face is Tjaden, who tells him the fates of several of their comrades. Paul finds Kat, who is on his way back from an unsuccessful search for food, and the friends greet each other warmly and discuss the grim outlook of the war. A bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, breaking Kat's shin, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital, only to find that a second explosion has killed Kat. Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul stumbles away while the medics play cards. Back on the front line, Paul sees a butterfly just outside of his fortification. Smiling, he reaches over the top of the sandbags to try to hold the butterfly and is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. Superimposed over the image of a veterans’ cemetery, Paul and his classmates are seen arriving at the front for the first time.",

Twenty-five years later, the men have grown apart.

Dave is married to Celeste, whose cousin Annabeth is Jimmy’s second wife, linking the men through family ties. Jimmy's teenage daughter Katie plans to elope to Las Vegas with Brendan Harris, the son of a man Jimmy despises. One night, Dave sees Katie at a bar. Later that evening, she is found murdered. That same night, Dave returns home bloodied and shaken, claiming to Celeste that he may have killed a mugger in self-defense . Sean and his partner, Whitey Powers, begin investigating the murder. Meanwhile, Jimmy conducts his own parallel inquiry using his connections. The detectives discover that the murder weapon is a .38 Special revolver tied to a 1984 liquor store robbery committed by Brendan’s father, “Just Ray” Harris, who has been missing since 1989. Brendan insists he knows nothing about the gun, though he claims Ray still sends the family money monthly. Suspicion grows around Dave as his story changes and his behavior becomes erratic. Celeste, increasingly afraid, eventually confides in Jimmy, believing Dave killed Katie. Jimmy and his associates invite Dave to a bar, get him drunk, and press him for a confession.

    "plot": "In 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge in England. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett, leaving him a poisoned apple, but he later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi . They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology . He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening , a biologist and ex- communist , and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock , a troubled communist psychiatrist whose death appears to be a suicide. [ a ] When nuclear fission is discovered in 1938, after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II , U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves , the director of the Manhattan Project , recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb . Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program , led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis sooner. Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe , and Edward Teller , and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi , Leo Szilard , and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago . Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world ; after consulting with Albert Einstein and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are \"near zero\". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay. After Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , resulting in Japan 's surrender . Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president accepts responsibility for ordering the bombings, but also berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development. As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War . AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonate their own bomb . Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947, though he had in fact expressed his belief that he had caused a chain reaction that would one day destroy the world . In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance , during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo court . Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty vigorously defends herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce , Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, with the deciding vote against Strauss given by the Senator of Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy , enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award .",

    "obfuscated_plot": "In the 1920s, a young doctoral student grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under a stern mentor at a prestigious university in Europe. The student clashes with his mentor, leaving a poisoned apple, but later retrieves it. A visiting scientist advises him to study theoretical physics at another European university. The student completes his PhD and meets fellow scientists. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in his home country, he teaches at multiple academic institutions. He marries a biologist with past political affiliations and has an intermittent affair with a troubled psychiatrist whose death appears to be a suicide.\n\nWhen nuclear fission is discovered in the late 1930s, after another country succeeds in splitting the atom, the scientist realizes it can be weaponized. During a global war, a military colonel recruits him to lead a secret laboratory to develop an atomic weapon. The scientist fears rival nuclear research might yield a weapon for the enemy. He assembles a team of brilliant scientists and collaborates with colleagues at another institution. Some team members calculate that a detonation could destroy the world, but after consulting with another renowned scientist, he concludes the chances are minimal.\n\nAfter the war in Europe ends, some scientists question the weapon's relevance. The scientist believes it would end the ongoing conflict in the Pacific and save lives. A weapons test is successful, and national leaders order atomic bombings of two enemy cities, resulting in the enemy's surrender. Though publicly praised, the scientist is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities.\n\nAs an advisor to a national energy commission, the scientist's stance generates controversy. A competing scientist's alternative weapon design receives renewed interest during rising international tensions. The commission's chairman resents the scientist for his public statements and seeks to diminish his influence. In a private security hearing, the scientist's loyalty is questioned, with his past political associations used against him. Despite his wife's vigorous defense, his security clearance is revoked, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on national nuclear policy.\n\nYears later, during a government confirmation hearing, details emerge about the chairman's personal vendetta. The chairman's nomination is narrowly defeated. Eventually, a national leader presents the scientist with a prestigious scientific award, partially rehabilitating his reputation."

On the day the war ends, the asylum's gatekeepers abandon their posts to join the celebration in the nearby Midlands town of Melbridge, and Smith wanders away. In town, he is befriended by a singer with the stage name Paula Ridgeway. She guesses he is from the asylum, but as he seems harmless, she arranges for him to join her traveling theatrical group. After an incident that threatens to bring unwanted attention, Paula takes Smith to a secluded country village in Devon, where they stay at an inn run by Mrs. Deventer. They fall in love and marry, renting a small cottage and eventually having a son. \"Smithy\", as Paula calls him, discovers he has some literary talent. Paula remains home with their newborn son while Smithy goes to Liverpool for a job interview with a newspaper. He is struck by a taxi. When he regains consciousness, his past memory is restored, but his life with Paula is now forgotten. He is Charles Rainier, the son of a wealthy businessman. None of his meager possessions, including a key, provide any clue about where he has been. Charles returns home on the day of his father's funeral. Kitty, the stepdaughter of one of Charles's siblings, becomes infatuated with her \"uncle.\" Charles wants to return to college, but the mismanaged family business needs him, and he puts off his own desires to safeguard the jobs of his many employees and restore the family fortune. After a few years, a newspaper touts him as the \"Industrial Prince of England.\" Meanwhile, Paula has been searching frantically for her Smithy. Their son died as an infant, and she now works as a secretary. One day, she sees Charles' picture and story in a magazine. Paula becomes his executive assistant under her real name, Margaret Hanson, hoping that her presence will jog his memory. Dr. Jonathan Benet, who works at the Melbridge asylum, is her confidant and admirer. He warns her that revealing her identity would only cause Charles to resent her. As Kitty grows up, she sends Charles love letters, and they become engaged. However, a hymn that Kitty is considering for their wedding triggers a vague memory in Charles. Kitty, realizing he still loves someone else, sadly breaks off the engagement. Margaret joins Charles in Liverpool, where he is trying one last time to piece together his lost years. They recover his old suitcase from a hotel's lost and found, but he recognizes nothing. Charles is approached to stand for Parliament . After his election, in which Margaret provides invaluable assistance, he feels the need for a wife in his new role. He proposes to her, more as a business proposition than a romantic one, and she accepts. They become an ideal couple, at least to all outward appearances, with Margaret a perfect society hostess. They discuss his lost past, and she tells him of her own lost love, without revealing that it is him. He hopes their life together can fill the void they both feel. After three years of marriage, she decides to take an extended solo vacation abroad. Before her liner sails, she revisits the village where she and Smithy lived.

    "plot": "In Stratford, Ontario , in 1904, William Spence ( Fredric March ), a medical student on the verge of becoming a doctor, receives \" The Call \" while passing a Methodist church one Sunday. His bride-to-be, Hope Morris ( Martha Scott ), accepts his decision to enter the ministry with a whole heart despite the disappointment of her prominent and affluent parents. Will \"dives right in,\" but, with no vacancies in Canada, is posted as a circuit minister to a small town in rural Iowa , beginning a life for them of frequent moves around the district, dingy parsonages , and scraping a living from poor boxes and performing weddings. Hope yearns for a decent parsonage and a sense of permanence for their children, but uncomplainingly provides them a good life and a supportive home for Will. For his part, Will understands his own nature and laughs at his own foibles, bending where he can in good conscience. He often enters situations in anger or to instruct but leaves humbled and renewed in spirit. While Will sincerely lives by and teaches by example (which includes his family) the tenets of the Methodist Discipline , he also learns from his congregations to be flexible and change with the times. When their third child, a boy, is born, Hope and Will cannot agree on a name and he remains unbaptized for three months. Hope wants to name the baby William Spence Jr., but Will does not like the idea of his son going without a middle name as he did. He wants the boy to have and be called in \"the good old Canadian custom\" by the middle name of Frazer. Will seems to give in to Hope but the following Sunday baptizes him William Frazer Spence. Hope serenely accepts the change. Oldest son Hartzell (named for Will's guiding bishop) has a hard time coping with the idea that a minister's son should be an example to the other boys. Will explains that \"a pastor's family walks a tightrope, balancing with one foot on earth and one foot already in Heaven .\" After learning that Hartzell has been sneaking into the movies, a pastime seemingly forbidden by the Discipline , Will takes him to the theater to point out why the film is bad for him. They see a western but rather than finding it sinful, Will is impressed by its moral. The following Sunday he preaches a sermon advising his congregation that young people may have something to teach their elders. In the 1920s, the family is assigned to a church in Denver, Colorado , that, despite having many well-heeled members, is old, uncomfortable and decrepit. In a time of economic prosperity for the country, the Spences cope with possibly their most dilapidated parsonage yet. Will has come to appreciate his wife's serenity with life and resolves to provide her a decent parsonage by building a new church. His plans at first are thwarted by power struggles among several snobbish members of the church. He loses one wealthy patron, Mrs. Sandow ( Beulah Bondi ), to the Baptists when he refuses to stop ministering to her chauffeur ( Harry Davenport ), and another, influential banker Preston Thurston ( Gene Lockhart ), after organizing a children's choir to replace the off-key church choir, run for years by Mrs. Thurston ( Laura Hope Crews ), her family and social circle. Soon after, Hartzell ( Frankie Thomas ) is expelled from school because of a gossip campaign falsely accusing him of making a young girl pregnant and forcing her family to move to San Francisco . A deeply discouraged Will investigates a job offer in California that offers the beautiful church and parsonage he and Hope have always dreamed of but discovers that he cannot surrender in his struggles with the Thurstons. He seeks out the girl's family and learns that there is no truth to any part of the rumor. Returning to Denver, Will confronts Mrs. Thurston and her circle, who started the rumors to punish Will, and suggests that if they don't contribute substantially to the building of the new church, he will call them out in his sermons. A repentant Mrs. Sandow begs to return to the church and Will inveigles from her the stained glass window , new Skinner organ , and carillon that as luxuries are being cut from the plans to finance a recreation center for the church. A year later, their dream church and parsonage finished, Will accepts the challenge of returning to Iowa to aid a small church in trouble, confident that he leaves behind a revitalized church when its members, including all those with whom he locked horns, gather spontaneously on a weekday morning to sing \" The Church's One Foundation \" as he plays it on the new carillon.",

However, the Williamses cannot afford professional coaching, and Paul refuses to coach both girls for free; he selects Venus to receive his coaching, while Serena continues to practice with Brandy. Paul encourages Venus to participate in juniors tournaments. She quickly finds success, but Richard stresses to Venus and her sister that they should remain humble despite their success. At one of Venus's tournaments, Serena also signs up to play, unbeknownst to Richard. As both girls continue to succeed, the family feel like outsiders among the predominantly white, upper-class competition. Richard meets with high-profile agents, but, fearing his daughters will be taken advantage of, pulls them out of the junior circuit entirely.

Taking Paula home, Gregory angrily claims that her mother died in an asylum , and that the letter she discovered from Sergis Bauer never existed. Doubting her own sanity, Paula breaks down. Meanwhile, Cameron has recruited a patrolman to watch Gregory, who they learn often visits an abandoned house nearby, and is planning to institutionalize Paula. While Gregory is out, Cameron offers Paula his help, confirming that the attic noises and flickering gaslights are indeed real. He deduces that Gregory has been entering his own attic through a skylight via the neighboring vacant house, to search through Alice's belongings. When he lights the attic lights, the gas to the downstairs lights is reduced. Cameron pries open Gregory's desk, and Paula finds the letter from Bauer that her husband insisted was a delusion. \"Gregory\" is actually Sergis Bauer, who murdered Alice but was interrupted by a young Paula before he could find her jewels. His marriage to Paula was a scheme to gain access to her aunt's home, followed by a cunning strategy to have Paula institutionalized and so gain full access to Alice's estate. At the same time, Sergis discovers the jewels hidden in plain sight, sewn into one of Alice's famous costumes. He returns downstairs to find his desk unlocked. He questions the mentally exhausted Paula, who admits the desk was opened by a man that was visiting her. To protect Paula, the kindly cook Elizabeth denies seeing any man and assures Sergis that this was merely a figment of Paula's imagination, driving Paula to despair. Cameron appears and confronts Sergis, chasing him into the attic and tying him to a chair. Finally convinced of her own sanity, Paula is left alone with Sergis, who urges her to cut him free.

    "plot": "In 1953, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) aims to improve its public image following decades of corruption. Career-focused sergeant Edmund Exley lives in the shadow of his legendary detective father, whose murderer was never identified; Exley names the suspect \"Rollo Tomasi,” representing any criminal who escapes justice. Fame-seeking narcotics sergeant Jack Vincennes collaborates with tabloid journalist Sid Hudgens to perform high-profile celebrity arrests, and volatile officer Wendell White uses violence to interrogate and intimidate suspects, particularly women-abusers, because his father murdered his mother. On Christmas Eve, White encounters high-class prostitutes Lynn Bracken and Susan Lefferts, and former officer Leland Meeks. They work for Pierce Patchett, a millionaire businessman operating Fleur-de-Lis , a clandestine prostitution ring hosting women surgically altered to resemble film stars. White begins a relationship with Bracken. Following the \" Bloody Christmas \" scandal—involving drunken officers beating inmates—Exley is promoted to detective lieutenant after persuading his superiors to save the department's reputation by only prosecuting securely pensioned officers. Exley coerces Vincennes to testify, while White refuses to comply and is suspended. White's partner Dick Stensland is fired for his involvement, making other officers hostile towards Exley. Following the imprisonment of powerful gangster Mickey Cohen , police captain Dudley Smith recruits White to frighten off criminals attempting to take Cohen's place. A spate of murders targeting Cohen's underlings leads to the disappearance of 25 lb (11 kg) of his heroin. Exley investigates a massacre at the Nite Owl coffee house, with Stensland and Lefferts among the victims. Three African American felons are arrested for the crime, and interrogation reveals the men have been raping a captive woman. White rushes to free the woman and executes her captor, planting evidence to suggest he acted in self-defense. The African-Americans escape the station and are killed by Exley in the ensuing shootout, closing the case and earning him a medal for bravery. However, unable to ignore inconsistencies in the case, Exley and White continue the investigation independently. White interviews Lefferts's mother and discovers Meeks's body beneath her house. He interrogates Cohen's ex-bodyguard, Johnny Stompanato , who reveals Meeks was trying to sell the stolen heroin. Hudgens and Vincennes orchestrate a homosexual tryst between struggling actor Matt Reynolds and district attorney Ellis Loew to create blackmail photos. However, after Reynolds is found murdered, a guilt-ridden Vincennes joins Exley's investigation. Vincennes learns that Meeks and Stensland formerly worked together under Smith, and dropped an investigation into Patchett and Hudgens blackmailing prominent businessmen with photos of their illicit trysts. He then confronts Smith, who shoots him dead. With his last breath, Vincennes says \"Rollo Tomasi.\" Exley becomes suspicious when Smith asks him about \"Rollo Tomasi\", a name Exley disclosed only to Vincennes. Smith arranges for White to find photos taken by Hudgens of Bracken having sex with Exley. Enraged, White confronts and fights Exley until they realize that their investigations implicate Smith. They deduce that Stensland killed Meeks for the heroin, and Smith orchestrated the Nite Owl massacre to kill Stensland and framed the African-Americans. Exley and White interrogate Loew, discovering Smith and Patchett are taking over Cohen's empire and used the photos of him with Reynolds to coerce his cooperation. Exley and White later find Hudgens and Patchett murdered. Smith lures Exley and White into a remote ambush. Though badly wounded, the pair kill Smith's men. Smith offers to mislead the approaching police and further promote Exley, but Exley executes him to prevent him avoiding punishment. Despite Exley's evidence, LAPD officials decide to protect the department's image by claiming Smith died a hero; Exley agrees to cooperate as a second \"hero\" for further accolades.

Michael, troubled by Vincent's temper yet impressed by his loyalty, agrees to include Vincent in the family business. The head of the Vatican Bank , Archbishop Gilday, has accumulated a massive deficit of $769M. Michael offers $600M in exchange for the Vatican's shares in an international real estate company, Internazionale Immobiliare (a fictional company, but possibly a reference to the real-world Società Generale Immobiliare ), [ 6 ] which would give him a controlling interest . Immobiliare's board approves the offer, pending ratification by Pope Paul VI . Don Altobello , a New York Mafia boss and Connie's godfather, tells Michael that his partners on The Commission want to be involved with the Immobiliare deal. However, wanting to finally become legitimate, Michael pays them to sell his Las Vegas holdings instead. Zasa receives nothing and, declaring Michael to be his enemy, storms out. Don Altobello, assuring Michael that he can diplomatically resolve the matter, leaves to speak to Zasa. Moments later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and opens fire.

Altobello introduces Vincent to Licio Lucchesi, Immobiliare's chairman. Michael visits Cardinal Lamberto , anticipated to become the next pope, to discuss the deal. Lamberto persuades Michael to make his first confession in 30 years, during which Michael tearfully confesses that he ordered Fredo's murder. Lamberto says that Michael deserves to suffer for his sins, but can be redeemed. He gives him sacramental absolution, permanently forgiving all his past sins in the eyes of God. Michael discovers that the Immobiliare deal is an elaborate swindle, arranged by Lucchesi, Gilday and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig. Vincent tells Michael that Altobello has hired Mosca, a veteran hitman, to assassinate Michael. Mosca, disguised as a priest, kills Corleone family friend Don Tommasino as he returns to his villa. While Michael and Kay tour Sicily, Michael asks for Kay's forgiveness, and they admit that they still love each other. At Tommasino's funeral, Michael vows to sin no more.

    "plot": "Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor and Bauhaus -trained architect László Tóth immigrates to the United States after being forcibly separated from his wife, Erzsébet, and orphaned niece, Zsófia. As his ship enters New York Harbor , he sees the Statue of Liberty . In 1947, László travels to Philadelphia and stays with his cousin, Attila. He discovers that Attila has assimilated , anglicizing his name and converting to Catholicism. Attila reveals to a relieved László that Erzsébet and Zsófia are still alive but stuck in Europe. He offers László work with his furniture business, and the two are soon approached by Harry Lee Van Buren, who wishes to surprise his father, wealthy industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren, with a renovated library at his mansion near Doylestown, Pennsylvania . Following a drunken night of merriment, Attila's wife Audrey expresses her disdain for László and suggests he live elsewhere. Back at the mansion, Harrison is enraged by the surprise renovation and fires the men; Harry refuses to pay them. Attila blames László for the failed project, falsely accuses him of having made a pass at Audrey, and demands that he leave their home. Three years later, László, now a heroin addict, works as a laborer loading coal and lives in charity housing with his friend Gordon, an African-American single father. Harrison turns up to tell him the architectural community has lauded his modern library renovation, and that he has discovered László's past as an accomplished architect in Europe. He pays the money owed and invites László to a party, where he commissions a grand project in tribute to his late mother: The Van Buren Institute, a community center comprising a library, theater, gymnasium, and chapel. Work begins immediately with László living on site and employing Gordon. Harrison introduces László to his personal lawyer, who expedites the immigration of László's wife and niece. In 1953, László reunites with Erzsébet and Zsófia and discovers that as a result of their wartime suffering , Erzsébet is a full-time wheelchair user due to osteoporosis , and Zsófia is unable to speak . During construction, László clashes with contractors and consultants hired by Harrison, who depart from his design in an attempt to stay on budget. He agrees to work unpaid to make up for additional costs. Harry derides László as being merely \"tolerated\" and makes lewd remarks about Zsófia. Following the derailment of a train carrying materials and ensuing legal costs, a furious Harrison abandons the project and fires the workers. In 1958, László and Erzsébet have moved to New York City, where he works as a draftsman at an architecture firm, and she writes for a newspaper. Zsófia, having recovered her ability to speak, is expecting a child with her husband, Binyamin. They announce they are making Aliyah and moving to Jerusalem , much to the chagrin of László and Erzsébet. Harrison restarts the project and rehires László. While visiting Carrara to purchase marble , Harrison sodomizes an intoxicated László, calling him a societal leech whose people invite their own persecution. A traumatized László begins to unravel, becoming more belligerent and impulsively firing Gordon during an argument back on site. Recalling the prior contempt he received, he laments to Erzsébet that they are not welcome in America. After László almost kills Erzsébet by giving her heroin to soothe her pain, she proposes they move to Jerusalem and live with Zsófia, to which he agrees. Shortly afterwards, Erzsébet confronts Harrison at his home and calls him a rapist in front of his family and associates. An enraged Harry violently pushes her out, before his sister Maggie intervenes and helps her leave. Unable to find his father, Harry organizes a search party and tries to locate him within the institute. In 1980, Erzsébet has died, and a retrospective of László's work is held at the first Venice Biennale of Architecture . The exhibition showcases various projects built around the world in the ensuing years and includes the Van Buren Institute, finally completed in 1973. Zsófia, accompanied by her young adult daughter and an aging László in a wheelchair, gives a revelatory speech asserting that László designed spaces in the structure to resemble both Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. The structure, she implies, functions as a way of processing trauma. Zsófia ends her speech with a phrase she claims László used to tell her as a struggling young mother: \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\"",

Lovell, who orbited the Moon on Apollo 8 , tells his wife Marilyn that he will return to the Moon to walk on its surface. Three months later, as Lovell is conducting a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building , his boss Deke Slayton informs him that his crew will fly Apollo 13 instead of 14, swapping flights with Alan Shepard 's crew. Lovell, Ken Mattingly , and Fred Haise train for their mission. Days before launch in April 1970, Mattingly is exposed to German measles , and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert . Lovell resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband dying in space, and tells Lovell she will not go to Kennedy Space Center to see him off for an unprecedented fourth launch. She later changes her mind and surprises him. On launch day, Flight Director Gene Kranz in Houston's Mission Control Center gives the go for launch . As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, a second stage engine cuts off prematurely, but the craft reaches its Earth parking orbit . After the third stage fires again to send Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert performs the maneuver to turn the Command Module Odyssey around to dock with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pull it away from the spent rocket. Three days into the mission, by order of Mission Control, Swigert turns on the liquid oxygen stirring fans. An electrical short causes a tank to explode, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. Consumables manager Sy Liebergot convinces Kranz that shutting off two of Odyssey ' s three fuel cells offers the best chance to stop the leak, but this does not work. With only one fuel cell, mission rules dictate the Moon landing be aborted. Lovell and Haise power up Aquarius to use as a \"lifeboat\", while Swigert shuts down Odyssey to save its battery power for the return to Earth. Kranz charges his team with bringing the astronauts home, declaring \" failure is not an option \". Consumables manager John Aaron recruits Mattingly to help him improvise a procedure to restart Odyssey for the landing on Earth. As the crew watches the Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost dream of walking on its surface, then turns his crew's attention to the business of getting home. With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power and rationed water supply, the crew suffers from freezing conditions, and Haise develops a urinary tract infection . Swigert suspects Mission Control is concealing the fact they are doomed; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; but Lovell quashes the argument. As Aquarius ' s carbon dioxide filters run out, concentration of the gas approaches a dangerous level. Ground control improvises a \"Rube Goldberg\" device to make the Command Module 's incompatible filter cartridges work in the Lunar Module. With Aquarius ' s navigation systems shut down, the crew makes a vital course correction manually by steering the Lunar Module and controlling its engine. Mattingly and Aaron struggle to find a way to power up the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally read the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by drawing the extra power from Aquarius . When the crew jettisons the Service Module , they are surprised by the extent of the damage, raising the possibility that the ablative heat shield was compromised. As they release Aquarius and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that Odyssey ' s heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well, and the world watches Odyssey splash down and celebrates their return. As helicopters bring the crew aboard the USS Iwo Jima for a hero's welcome, Lovell's voice-over describes the cause of the explosion, and the subsequent careers of Haise, Swigert, Mattingly, Kranz, and himself. He wonders if and when mankind will return to the Moon.",

    "plot": "London music student Julian Craster attends a performance of the ballet Heart of Fire , performed by the eminent travelling ballet company Ballet Lermontov and scored by his professor. Also present are young dancer Victoria 'Vicky' Page and her aunt Lady Neston. Julian furiously walks out after recognising that the professor has plagiarised his compositions. Lady Neston hosts an after-party in honour of the Ballet Lermontov's impresario , Boris Lermontov. After Vicky tells Boris that dancing is the most important thing in her life, Boris invites her to spend time with his ballet before it leaves for Paris. He hires Vicky full-time after watching her dance the lead in Swan Lake with Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre . Julian angrily writes a letter to Boris exposing his professor's misconduct. He has a change of heart and visits Boris to take the letter back, but Boris has already read it and is sympathetic. Boris hires Julian as a répétiteur and assistant to the company's conductor. He soon grows impressed with Julian's artistic ambition. In Paris, Ballet Lermontov's principal dancer Irina Boronskaya is required to leave the company upon getting married, per company policy. Although Boris's official rationale is that love distracts from artistic excellence, the film also reveals that he takes his coworkers' emotional lives (which he lacks) as a personal slight, due to his jealousy of their happiness. The company proceeds to Monaco. In Irina's absence, Boris casts Vicky as the lead in a new ballet, The Ballet of the Red Shoes (based on the Andersen fairytale ), and hires Julian to score it. In the ballet, a dancer acquires a pair of red ballet shoes which enable her to dance with superhuman skill, but at a price: she can never stop dancing until she dies. During rehearsals, Julian and Vicky's ambition and pride lead them to clash at first—to Boris's glee. However, they develop respect for each other as artists. The Ballet of the Red Shoes is a resounding success. Boris revitalises the company's repertoire with Vicky as the prima ballerina and Julian as the star composer. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian fall in love. Although Boris is not romantically attracted to Vicky, he is emotionally possessive of his new star. [ b ] He tries to break up the relationship by telling them that their work is getting worse, but it is implied that he is projecting his own insecurities onto the relationship, as Boris's choreographer is full of praise for Julian. Boris gives Julian an ultimatum to break up with Vicky or leave the company. Julian and Vicky move back to London together and get married. Boris breaks his no-marriage rule to rehire Irina, but cannot mentally let go of Vicky. In London, Vicky and Julian's careers go in different directions. Julian writes an opera that is set to open in Covent Garden , while Vicky's ballet career stalls. Vicky goes on holiday to Cannes without Julian, who is focused on his work. Boris meets her there. He reminds Vicky that she is the one making all the sacrifices in her marriage, and persuades her to \"put on the red shoes again\". Coincidentally, the opening night of Julian's opera in London falls on the same date as Vicky's comeback performance in Monaco. Although Julian is supposed to conduct on opening night, he abruptly leaves for Monaco as a grand gesture for Vicky. In return, he insists that Vicky cancel her performance and leave Monaco and Boris immediately. After Julian and Boris have a heated argument about the value of art versus love, an anguished Vicky chooses to stay with Ballet Lermontov. An attendant escorts Vicky to the stage. She is wearing the titular red shoes, and looks faint. She suddenly runs off and jumps in front of an oncoming train, paralleling her ill-fated character in the ballet. Julian tries to save her, but cannot. As Vicky dies, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes. A shaken Boris announces to the audience that \"Miss Page is unable to dance tonight—nor indeed any other night\".

Todd is assigned one of Welton's top students, junior Neil Perry, as his roommate, and through Neil, he meets his friends: Knox Overstreet, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks, Gerard Pitts, and Charlie Dalton. On the first day of classes, the boys are taken aback by the unusual teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating. A Welton alumnus who studied English Literature at Cambridge , Keating encourages his students to \"seize the day\", referencing the Latin expression carpe diem . Keating has the students take turns standing on his desk to demonstrate ways to look at life differently, tells them to rip out the introduction of their poetry books that explains a mathematical formula for rating poetry, and invites them to make up their own style of walking in a courtyard to encourage their individualism. Keating's methods attract the attention of strict headmaster Gale Nolan. Upon learning that Keating had been a member of the unofficial Dead Poets Society during his time as a student at Welton, Neil restarts the club, and he and his friends sneak off campus to a cave, where they read poetry. Keating's lessons and their involvement with the club encourage them to live their lives on their own terms. Knox pursues Chris Noel, a cheerleader who is dating Chet Danburry, a football player from a local public school, and whose family is friends with his. Neil discovers his love of acting, and gets the role of Puck in a local production of A Midsummer Night's Dream , despite the disapproval of his controlling father, who wants him to attend Harvard for medical school. Keating helps Todd come out of his shell and realize his potential when he takes him through an exercise in self-expression, resulting in his spontaneously composing a poem in front of the class. Charlie publishes an article in the school newspaper, on behalf of the club, recommending that girls be admitted to Welton. In response, Nolan paddles Charlie, attempting to force him to reveal who else is in the Dead Poets Society; but Charlie remains defiant. Nolan also confronts Keating, advising him that he should discourage his students from questioning authority. Keating gently admonishes Charlie, advising the boys that one must assess all potential consequences of one's actions. On the eve of the play's opening performance, Neil's father discovers his involvement in the play and demands that he quit immediately. Keating advises Neil to explain to his father that he is passionate about acting and takes it seriously. After Neil performs in the play, his father retaliates by telling him he will withdraw him from Welton the following morning and enroll him in Braden Military School. Lacking any support from his mother and unable to explain to his father how he feels, Neil commits suicide using his father's gun. At Neil's parents' request, Nolan investigates his death. During the investigation, Cameron shifts blame onto Keating to avoid punishment for his role in the Dead Poets Society, and he names the other members of the group. When Charlie confronts him over this, Cameron urges the other students to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is expelled. Each of the boys is called to Nolan's office to sign a letter confirming Cameron's false allegations. When Todd's turn comes, he reluctantly signs the letter under his parents' pressure, and Keating is fired as a result. Nolan, who had taught English at Welton prior to becoming headmaster, temporarily takes over Keating's English class. As Keating interrupts the class to gather his belongings, Todd confesses that the boys were pressured into signing the letter that led to his dismissal. Keating assures Todd that he believes him. Nolan threatens to expel Todd and anyone else who speaks out of line. Despite the threat, Todd stands up on his desk and says \" O Captain! My Captain! \".

Catherine's beautiful and accomplished mother died giving birth, and Catherine’s awkwardness constantly reminds her father of the poor exchange for his beloved wife. Widowed Aunt Lavinia Penniman, on an extended visit with her brother, helps Catherine improve her social skills. At a ball, Catherine meets handsome, charming Morris Townsend, a polished young man who squandered a small inheritance on a European Grand Tour . Encouraged by Aunt Penniman, Morris artfully pursues Catherine, who he knows through her family connections will inherit $40,000 annually. At first Catherine is overwhelmed by his persistence; starved for affection, however, she quickly falls in love. Suspecting Morris is a fortune hunter, Dr. Sloper consults with Morris's widowed sister, who reluctantly makes admissions that confirm Sloper’s opinion. Before approaching Sloper to formally request Catherine's hand in marriage, Morris improperly makes Catherine pledge herself to him. Pointing out the impropriety, Sloper rejects him. When Catherine persists, Sloper insists on taking her on an extended European trip to separate the pair as a test. Catherine informs Morris that she already has a substantial $10,000 inheritance from her mother and does not need her father's approval. Morris claims that he is loath to estrange her from her father, and she should appease him. While Catherine and her father are away, Morris frequents the Sloper home like a private club, enjoying Aunt Penniman’s hospitality and Sloper’s cigars and brandy. Disappointed with his daughter’s intransigence in her devotion to Morris, Sloper cuts the trip short. Upon returning home, he reveals to Catherine his low opinion of her merits, believing her dim for thinking any suitor would have an interest in her beyond her inheritance. He threatens to cut her out of his will if she marries Morris. Catherine now fully realizes the depth of her father's disdain. Wounded and angry, Catherine is convinced that Morris's love is compensation for her father's coldness. She begs Morris to arrange their immediate elopement, not wanting to spend another night in her father's home. Morris holds out hope that her father will eventually relent, but Catherine insists that even if her father relents, she will never accept anything from him again. Reluctantly, Morris agrees to elope and leaves to pack his belongings. Catherine waits with her bags packed, and Aunt Penniman stays with her, dismayed that Catherine revealed to Morris that there would be no money from her father. As the appointed time comes and passes without his arrival, Catherine realizes that Morris has abandoned her. Pondering why Morris was not satisfied with her substantial $10,000 left by her mother, her aunt explains it is a disappointment because he expected she would also receive an additional $30,000 upon her father's death. Days afterward, Sloper reveals he is dying and asks Catherine when she plans to leave with Morris. When Catherine admits that the elopement is off, Sloper expresses pride that Catherine has rejected Morris, but Catherine bitterly informs him that she was jilted. Catherine shrilly expresses that Sloper has denied her even the chance to \"buy\" a husband who at least would hide that he does not love her. She tells her father that if he leaves her his money, he will never know whether she wastes it on Morris or another fortune hunter. Sloper admits that he does not want to disinherit her and accepts that she can do as she pleases when he is gone. Hardened, Catherine refuses to come to his bedside as he is dying. Years later, wealthy, independent, and single, Catherine still lives in the Washington Square house with her aunt. Aunt Penniman informs Catherine that Morris has returned from California and wishes to explain himself. Initially reluctant, Catherine eventually agrees to see him. Now destitute, Morris attempts to win Catherine back, saying that he left, selflessly, not to estrange her from her father. Chiding him for not being as impetuous as he used to be, Catherine suggests they carry out the delayed elopement. Morris eagerly leaves to pack.

Eventually, Virginia brings up the possibility of marriage. They marry on May 7, but Virginia acts erratically again. She cannot sleep and loses touch with reality, as she feels it is November and snaps when Robert corrects her. The rest of the film follows her therapy. Dr. Kik puts her through electro-shock treatment and narcosynthesis . [ 6 ] Dr. Kik wants to get to the \"causes of her unconscious rejection.\"  The film includes many flashbacks, including her earlier failed engagement to Gordon as well as childhood issues. The film shows her progress and what happens to her along the way. The mental hospital is organized on a system of wards, with the best functioning patients assigned to the wards with the lowest numbers, which have better furnishings and more relaxed rules for patient behavior. Virginia moves to the lowest level (One), where she is treated well by a young nurse but is picked on by Nurse Davis, the only truly abusive nurse in the hospital. Davis is jealous of Dr. Kik's interest in Virginia, which she sees as excessive. Nurse Davis goads Virginia into an outburst which results in Virginia being straitjacketed and expelled from Level One into the \"snake pit\", where patients considered beyond help are simply placed together in a large padded cell and abandoned. Dr. Kik, learning of this, has Virginia returned to Level One, but away from Nurse Davis's care. Despite this setback, Dr. Kik's care continues to improve Virginia's mental state. Over time, Virginia gains insight and self-understanding, and is able to leave the hospital. The film depicts the bureaucratic regimentation of the institution, the staff (some unkind and aloof, some kind and empathetic), and relationships between patients, from which Virginia learns as much as she does in therapy.",

    "plot": "In the distant future, Duke Leto Atreides is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to replace Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as the fiefholder of Arrakis , a harsh desert planet and the sole source of \" spice \", a valuable psychotropic substance that imparts heightened vitality and awareness. Spice is also key to interstellar travel , giving Spacing Guild Navigators the ability to guide starships to traverse space instantaneously and safely. Emperor Shaddam, fearful of Leto's rising power, plots for House Harkonnen to retake Arrakis, secretly aided by his Sardaukar troops, and destroy House Atreides. Leto is suspicious of the Emperor but weighs the risks against the power of controlling Arrakis and making an alliance with its mysterious natives, the Fremen . Leto's concubine , Lady Jessica , is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit —an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of a centuries-long breeding program , they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach—a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the prescience necessary to guide humanity to a better future. Jessica disobeyed and bore a son, Paul , who is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho , Gurney Halleck , the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh , and the Mentat Thufir Hawat , and she teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan about troubling visions of the future. The Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam subjects Paul to a deadly gom jabbar test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes. House Atreides arrives at Arrakeen , the principal stronghold on Arrakis. Duncan's advance party has made contact with the Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which she explains is due to the Bene Gesserit sowing beliefs on Arrakis centuries earlier. An attempt to assassinate Paul with a hunter-seeker fails. At a secret meeting on the Harkonnen planet Giedi Prime , Mohiam insists Baron Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica in his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees. Leto meets and negotiates with Fremen chieftain Stilgar and meets the Imperial Judge of the Change , Dr. Liet Kynes , a planetologist who lives among the Fremen. Kynes briefs them on the dangers of spice harvesting, and the giant sandworms that travel under the desert and render unwise the use of protective shields . During a flight, they rescue a stranded spice-harvesting crew from a sandworm, and Paul's exposure to the spice triggers intense premonitions. Yueh betrays the Atreides and disables Arrakeen's shields, allowing the Harkonnens and Sardaukar to invade. He incapacitates Leto, planning to exchange him for his wife, the Baron's prisoner. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule with which the Duke can assassinate the Baron. After the Baron double-crosses and murders Yueh, Leto releases the gas, killing himself and the Baron's Mentat, Piter De Vries , but the Baron survives. Though the Baron has arranged to have Paul and Jessica dropped deep in the desert to die, a compassionate Yueh has left them with a fremkit with survival supplies. Jessica uses a Bene Gesserit technique called \" the Voice \" to overpower and kill their captors. Overnighting in the desert, Paul—surrounded by spice—has visions of a bloody holy war fought across the universe in his name. After conquering Arrakis, Baron Harkonnen appoints his nephew Rabban to oversee the planet, and orders him to restart spice production to recoup the invasion's cost. Meanwhile, Duncan and Kynes find Jessica and Paul, who discloses his plan to marry one of Emperor Shaddam's daughters to avert a potential civil war arising from the Emperor's betrayal. They are discovered by Sardaukar soldiers armed with a lasgun , and Duncan sacrifices himself, enabling Paul and Jessica's escape. Kynes also tries to escape but is caught and mortally wounded, and lures a sandworm to her location to devour herself and the Sardaukar. Deep in the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's Fremen tribe, including Chani , the young woman from Paul's visions. When Stilgar commands lenience towards them, Fremen warrior Jamis challenges his authority, and challenges them to a ritual duel to the death, which Paul accepts and wins. Contrary to Jessica's wishes, Paul joins the Fremen, determined to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.",

Her adviser, Dr. Randall Mindy, confirms that it will collide with Earth in approximately six months and is large enough to cause a global extinction event . NASA verifies the findings, and Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe, head of their Planetary Defense Coordination Office , accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to the White House . However, they are met with apathy from President Janie Orlean and her Chief of Staff Jason Orlean, who is also her son. Oglethorpe encourages Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, which they then do, on The Daily Rip , a popular morning talk show . When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic lightly, Dibiasky loses her temper and angrily rants about the threat before she flees the scene. Mindy receives public approval for his looks, while Dibiasky becomes the subject of negative memes for her on-air behavior. Public reaction is muted, and the whole thing is downplayed by NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a top donor to Orlean with no background in astronomy. When Orlean's sexual relations with Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon hit the front page, the president tries to divert public attention to the looming threat of the comet, announcing a project to use nuclear weapons to strike and divert the comet . The mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements . The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergone peer review . Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as the National Science Advisor . Dibiasky attempts to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee. World opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home to Illinois , her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally breaks down and rants on national television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference. Cut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign on social media , telling people to \"Just Look Up\" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. Simultaneously, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people \"Don't Look Up\". Orlean and BASH cut Russia , India , and China out of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. As the comet becomes larger in the sky, Orlean's supporters start turning on her administration. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed. Isherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board a sleeper spaceship designed to find an Earth-like planet , inadvertently leaving Jason behind. Orlean offers Mindy two places on the ship, but he declines, choosing to spend a final evening with his friends and family.

Donovan , formerly general counsel to the Office of Strategic Services but now in private practice in insurance law, is appointed to be Abel's legal counsel. Committed to the principle that the accused deserves a vigorous defense, he mounts the best defense of Abel he can, declining along the way to cooperate in the attempts of the Central Intelligence Agency (the successor to his former employer, the OSS) to induce him to violate the confidentiality of his communications with his client. Abel is convicted, but Donovan convinces the judge to spare him the death penalty because he had been serving his country honorably, and he might prove useful for a future prisoner exchange; Abel is sentenced to 30 years. Donovan appeals the conviction to the Supreme Court based on the lack of a search warrant for the seizure of Abel's ciphers and photography equipment. For his principled stand, Donovan and his family are harassed, including shots being fired at their home. The conviction is upheld in a very close margin. In 1960, Francis Gary Powers , a pilot in the CIA's top-secret U-2 spy plane program, is shot down over the USSR . He is captured and sentenced to ten years' confinement, including three years in prison. Donovan receives a letter from East Germany , purportedly sent by Abel's wife, thanking him and urging him to get in contact with their lawyer, whose name is Vogel . The CIA thinks this is a back-channel message hinting that the USSR is willing to swap Powers for Abel. They unofficially ask Donovan to go to Berlin to negotiate the exchange; he arrives just as the Berlin Wall is going up. Crossing into East Berlin , he meets with a KGB officer in the Soviet Embassy and is then directed to Vogel, who represents the Attorney General of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The Attorney General seeks to swap Abel for an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor , who had been arrested in East Germany; in the process, the GDR hopes to gain official recognition by the United States. The CIA wants Donovan to disregard Pryor, but he insists that both Pryor and Powers be swapped for Abel. In a message to the Attorney General, he bluffs that they will either release Pryor with Powers or there will be no deal. The exchange of Powers and Abel is to take place at the Glienicke Bridge , with Pryor to be released simultaneously at Checkpoint Charlie . Tension builds as Pryor fails to arrive. The CIA, still primarily concerned with Powers, tell Abel he can go, but Abel, out of respect for Donovan's dedication to both his own case and securing Pryor's release, refuses to move. It is confirmed that Pryor has been released, and the exchange takes place.

The crew is a motley, fun-loving, hard-drinking lot. Among them is their consensus leader, a middle-aged Irishman named Driscoll; a young Swedish ex-farmer, Ole Olsen; a spiteful steward nicknamed Cocky; a brooding Lord Jim -like Englishman, Smitty; and a burly, thoroughly dependable bruiser, Davis. On a sultry night in a port in the West Indies, the crew has been confined to the ship by order of the captain, but Drisk has arranged to import a boatload of local ladies.

They are also concerned that Smitty might be a German spy because he is so aloof and secretive. After they assault Smitty and restrain and gag him, they force him to give up the key to a small metal box they have found in his bunk. Opening the box against Smitty's vigorous protests, they discover a packet of letters from Smitty's wife revealing the fact that Smitty has been an alcoholic, dishonorably discharged from the British navy.

At the end of the street is a dock on the East River; to the left are the luxury apartments, and to the right are the slums. The Dead End Kids, led by Tommy Gordon, are a gang of street urchins who are already well on the path to a life of petty crime.  Members of the gang besides Tommy include Dippy, Angel, Spit, T.B., and Milty, the new kid on the block in search of friends.  Spit is a bit malicious with a cruel streak, and initially bullies the newcomer and takes his pocket change. However, Tommy eventually lets Milty join the gang, and he turns out to be both a loyal and generous friend. Tommy's sister, Drina, dreams of marrying some dashing, rich stranger, who will save  Tommy and her from this miserable life of poverty, and help prevent Tommy from growing up to be a mobster like Hugh \"Baby Face\" Martin, who has returned to the neighborhood with his partner Hunk to visit his mother and childhood girlfriend.  Dave Connell, raised on the same street as Martin, recognizes him and warns him to stay away, but Martin contemptuously ignores him. Dave, a frustrated architect who currently works odd jobs, is Drina's childhood friend.  He is having an affair with a rich man's mistress, Kay Burton.  Although Dave and Kay love each other, they know they cannot be together because Dave cannot provide Kay with the kind of lifestyle she desires. Meanwhile, the kids lure Philip, a rich kid from the apartments, into a cellar, where they beat and rob him.  When the boy's father, a judge, tries to intervene, Tommy winds up stabbing him in the arm.  He escapes the police and goes into hiding. Martin is subsequently rejected by his mother, who denounces him as a murderer, and repulsed by his ex-girlfriend, Francey, who says she is tired and \"sick\". He realizes she is now a prostitute and dismisses her with a few twenties pulled from a wad of cash. Despondent over the failed visit, he decides to kidnap the rich child for ransom to make the trip back worthwhile.  Dave sees Martin and his accomplices planning the kidnapping, and again warns him to leave.  Martin knifes him, and Hunk pushes him into the river.  Managing to pull himself out of the river, Dave pursues the hoodlums, knocking out Hunk and chasing Martin on the rooftops before cornering him on a fire escape.  Amid a hail of bullets, he manages to mortally wound Martin, who falls onto the street below. While on the ground, Martin engages oncoming police officers in a firefight, shooting a couple before they open fire and kill him. As the police and a crowd of people gather around Martin's body, the doorman recognizes Spit as being a member of the gang that attacked the rich kid's father, and identifies him to Officer Mulligan. Spit exonerates himself by informing the police that the man was cut by Tommy, who has returned to say goodbye to Drina before running away. Meanwhile, Kay approaches Dave, asking him to go away with her, using the reward money that he is owed for killing Martin.  Dave refuses, and Kay returns to the man whom she does not love, but who can provide her with financial security. Tommy hears of Spit's betrayal, and tries to give him the mark of the \"squealer\", which is a knife wound across the cheek.  Before he can do so, Dave intervenes, and  Drina and he convince Tommy to surrender to the police. Dave then offers to use his reward money to pay for Tommy's defense.  As Drina, Dave, and Tommy leave with Mulligan, the rest of the Dead End Kids meander off into the night, singing \"If I had the wings of an angel, over these prison walls I would fly\".",

    "name": "Vice",
    "plot": "Vice is narrated by Kurt, a fictitious veteran of the Afghan and Iraq wars. In 1963, Dick Cheney works as a lineman in Wyoming after dropping out of Yale University . After Cheney is stopped by a traffic cop for driving while intoxicated , his wife Lynne tells him to clean up his life or she will leave him. In 1969, Cheney finds work as a White House intern during Richard Nixon 's presidency . Working under Nixon's economic adviser, Donald Rumsfeld , Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, Liz and Mary . Cheney overhears Henry Kissinger discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia with Nixon, revealing the true power of the executive branch to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after Nixon's resignation in 1974 , Cheney rises to the position of White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford , while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defense . The media later dubs the sudden shake-up in the cabinet as the Halloween Massacre . During his tenure, a young Antonin Scalia introduces Cheney to the unitary executive theory . After Ford loses the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter , Cheney runs for Congress in Wyoming . After giving an awkward and uncharismatic campaign speech, Cheney suffers his first heart attack. While he recovers, Lynne campaigns on her husband's behalf, helping him to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . During the Reagan Administration , Cheney supports a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the fossil fuel industries, as well as the abolition of the FCC fairness doctrine , which contributed to the rise of Fox News , conservative talk radio , and the increasing level of party polarization in the United States. Cheney next serves as Secretary of Defense under President George H. W. Bush during the Gulf War . Outside of politics, Cheney and Lynne come to terms with their younger daughter, Mary, coming out as a lesbian . Though Cheney develops ambitions to run for president, he decides to retire from public life due to lack of presidential polling enthusiasm for him and to spare Mary from media scrutiny. Cheney becomes the CEO of Halliburton while his wife breeds golden retrievers and writes books. A sarcastic false epilogue claims that Cheney lived the rest of his life healthy and happy in the private sector and credits begin rolling, only for them to end abruptly as the film continues. Cheney is invited to become the running mate of George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election . Under the impression that Bush is more interested in impressing his father than attaining power for himself, Cheney agrees on the condition that Bush delegates executive responsibilities to him and avoids getting him involved in the Republican Party's stance against gay rights . As vice president, Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington , Mary Matalin , and Chief of Staff Scooter Libby to exercise control of key foreign policy and defense decisions. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks , Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuver to initiate and preside over the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq . Various other events from his vice presidency are depicted, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the Plame affair , the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington , and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage . Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq , resulting in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration . As he is narrating Cheney's deathbed goodbye to his family after another heart attack, Kurt dies in a road traffic incident. His healthy heart is transplanted into Cheney. Liz states her opposition to same-sex marriage while running for a Senate seat a few months later, and Cheney does not object. This upsets Mary, who distances herself from her family. Liz wins election to her father's former position in the House two years later. An irate Cheney breaks the fourth wall and delivers a monologue to the audience at the end of the film, declaring he has no regrets about anything he has done in his career. In a mid-credit scene, some members of a focus group reviewing the film get into a heated debate about the film's effectiveness and the Trump administration , while others are uninterested and would rather discuss the latest Fast & Furious movie.",

    "plot": "Farm girl Esther Victoria Blodgett yearns to become a Hollywood actress. Although her aunt and father discourage such thoughts, Esther's grandmother gives Esther her savings to follow her dream. So, she goes to Hollywood and tries to land a job as an extra, but so many others have had the same idea that the casting agency has stopped accepting applications. Esther is told that her chances of becoming a star are one in 100,000. She befriends a new resident at her boarding house, assistant director Danny McGuire, himself out of work. When they go together to a concert to celebrate Danny's employment, Esther has her first encounter with Norman Maine, an actor she admires greatly. He has been a major star for years, but his alcoholism has sent his career into a downward spiral. Danny gets Esther a one-time waitressing job at a fancy Hollywood party. While serving hors d'œuvres, she catches Norman's eye. The next day, he gets his longtime producer and good friend, Oliver Niles, to give her a screen test. Impressed, he gives her a contract and a new name, \"Vicki Lester\". Esther practices her few lines for her first tiny role. When the studio has trouble finding a female lead for Norman's current film, titled The Enchanted Hour, Norman persuades Oliver to cast Esther. The film makes her an overnight success, just as cinemagoers and exhibitors continue to lose interest in Norman. Norman proposes to Esther, which she accepts when he promises to give up drinking. They elope without publicity, much to press agent Matt Libby's disgust, and enjoy a trailer-camping honeymoon in the mountains. When they return, Esther's popularity continues to skyrocket, and Norman realizes that his own career is over despite Oliver's attempts to help him. Norman stays sober for a while, but his frustration over his situation finally pushes him over the edge, and he starts drinking again. When Esther wins the industry's top award (the Academy Award for Best Actress ), he interrupts her acceptance speech by drunkenly demanding three awards for the worst acting of the year and accidentally slapping her when he dramatically swings his arms back. A stay at a sanatorium seems to cure Norman's increasingly disruptive alcoholism, but a chance encounter with Libby allows the press agent to vent his long-concealed contempt. Norman goes on a four-day drinking binge, and he is arrested for drunk driving. In court, the judge sentences him to 90 days of incarceration, but Esther pleads with the judge to put Norman under her care. The judge, who is impressed with Esther's acting success, suspends Norman's sentence and puts his custody into Esther's hands. Esther decides to give up her career to devote herself to his rehabilitation. After Norman overhears her discussing her plan with Oliver, he drowns himself in the Pacific Ocean. Shattered, Esther decides to quit and go home. Showing up soon afterward is her grandmother, who has heard that Esther is quitting. Her grandmother tells her of a letter Norman sent her when they got married. The letter stated how proud he was of Esther and how much he loved her. Due to her grandmother's words and the reminder of Norman's deep love, Esther is convinced to stay in show business. At the premiere of her next film at Grauman's Chinese Theatre , when Esther is asked to say a few words into the microphone to her many fans listening across the world, she announces \"Hello, everybody.

Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or defy his authority in any manner. After press ganging a crew out of a local pub, the Bounty sets sail from Portsmouth on a two-year voyage across the Pacific , to transport breadfruit from the Polynesian islands to Jamaica . Fletcher Christian , the ship's executive officer , is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti , where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island and lives with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani, and he compiles an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees, but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti . Christian promises her he will be back someday. After leaving Tahiti, the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr. Bacchus, and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land. Meanwhile, Christian orders that Bounty return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends. Months later, Byam is married to Tehani, and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship HMS Pandora is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife, and several Tahitian men and women back on board Bounty in search of a new island on which to seek refuge. Byam boards Pandora and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England, Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard Bounty . Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks and Lord Hood , Byam is pardoned by King George III and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.

Frankie is a cantankerous Irish-American trainer estranged from his daughter. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he refuses because he does not want to train women and believes Maggie is too old. Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris, Frankie's friend and the gym's handyman, allows her to train at the Hit Pit regardless. Frankie's prize prospect, \"Big Willie\" Little, signs with rival manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout, so Maggie gets her chance. With Frankie's coaching, Maggie fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division. Since she has earned a reputation for quick knockouts, Frankie bribes managers to put their trainee fighters against her. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for Maggie with Mack, but out of loyalty to Frankie, she declines. Frankie bestows Maggie a Gaelic nickname embroidered on her boxing robe, Mo Cuishle , but does not tell her its meaning. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win. Maggie eventually saves enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house. Nevertheless, her mother berates Maggie for endangering her welfare checks, claiming everyone back home laughs at her.

Maggie lands hard on her corner stool, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic . Frankie goes through the five stages of grief , seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, lashing out in anger at Scrap, and trying to bargain with God through prayer.

He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of his past self as Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis . Riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver 's short story \" What We Talk About When We Talk About Love \". However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is essential to Riggan's identity. Riggan's best friend and lawyer Jake is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway newcomer Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, works as his assistant. A light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star Ralph the day before the first preview. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over replacing his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and complains that the prop gun does not look natural. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her smoking marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him that he is irrelevant and the play is for his own vanity. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a New York Times interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. During the final preview, after seeing Mike and Sam kissing backstage, Riggan goes for a smoke and accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his briefs and enter through the audience to begin the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show, and she thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him. Riggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a cynical and highly influential theater critic. She reveals her hatred for him and promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without seeing it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he visualizes Birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater. On opening night, the play goes very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago, he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about the Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia leaves, Riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself seemingly through the head on stage. The play receives a standing ovation . Riggan wakes up in a hospital and learns he merely shot off his nose, which has been surgically reconstructed. Tabitha has published a glowing review of the play, mistaking the suicide attempt for a new acting technique. Sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and says goodbye to Birdman. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling at what she sees.",

    "name": "All the President's Men",
    "plot": "On June 17, 1972, a security guard at the Watergate complex finds a door's bolt taped over to prevent it from locking. He calls the police, who find and arrest five burglars in the Democratic National Committee headquarters within the complex. The next morning, The Washington Post assigns new reporter Bob Woodward to the local courthouse to cover the story, which is considered of minor importance. Woodward learns that the five men — James W. McCord Jr. and four Cuban-Americans from Miami—possessed electronic bugging equipment, and are represented by a high-priced \"country club\" attorney. At the arraignment, McCord identifies himself in court as having recently left the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the others are also revealed to have CIA ties. Woodward connects the burglars to E. Howard Hunt , an employee of President Richard Nixon 's White House counsel Charles Colson , and formerly of the CIA. Carl Bernstein , another Post reporter, is assigned to cover the Watergate story with Woodward. The two young men are reluctant partners but work well together. Executive editor Benjamin Bradlee believes that their work lacks reliable sources and is not worthy of the Post' s front page, but he encourages further investigation. Woodward contacts a senior government official, an anonymous source he has used before and refers to as \" Deep Throat \". Communicating secretly, using a flag placed in a balcony flowerpot to signal meetings, they meet at night in an underground parking garage . Deep Throat speaks vaguely and with metaphors, avoiding substantial facts about the Watergate break-in, but promises to keep Woodward on the right path to the truth, advising Woodward to \" follow the money \". Woodward and Bernstein connect the five burglars to corrupt activities involving campaign contributions to Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP or CREEP). This includes a check for $25,000 paid by Kenneth H. Dahlberg , who Miami authorities identified when investigating the Miami-based burglars. However, Bradlee and others at the Post still doubt the investigation and its dependence on sources such as Deep Throat, wondering why the Nixon administration should break the law when the president is almost certain to defeat his opponent, Democratic nominee George McGovern . Through former CREEP treasurer Hugh W. Sloan Jr. , Woodward and Bernstein connect a slush fund of hundreds of thousands of dollars to White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman —\"the second most important man in this country\"—and to former attorney general John N. Mitchell , now head of CREEP. They learn that CREEP was financing a \" ratfucking \" campaign to sabotage Democratic presidential candidates a year before the Watergate burglary, when Nixon was lagging Edmund Muskie in the polls. While Bradlee's demand for thoroughness compels the reporters to obtain other sources to confirm the Haldeman connection, the White House issues a non-denial denial of the Post' s above-the-fold story. Bradlee continues to encourage investigation. Woodward again meets secretly with Deep Throat and demands that he be less evasive. Very reluctantly, Deep Throat reveals that Haldeman masterminded the Watergate break-in and cover-up . He also states the cover-up was not only intended to camouflage the CREEP involvement, but also to hide \"covert operations\" involving \"the entire U.S. intelligence community\", including the CIA and FBI . He warns Woodward and Bernstein that their lives, and those of others, are in danger. When the two relay this information to Bradlee and tell him of the depth of the conspiracy, Bradlee realizes that a constitutional crisis is coming, but tells them to move forward with the story. During the second inauguration of Richard Nixon on January 20, 1973, Bernstein and Woodward type the full story, while a television in the newsroom shows Nixon taking the oath of office for his second term as president. A montage of Watergate-related teletype headlines from the following years is shown, ending with the report of Nixon's resignation and the inauguration of Gerald Ford on August 9, 1974.",

    "name": "The Holdovers",
    "plot": "In December 1970, Paul Hunham is a teacher at Barton Academy, a New England all-male boarding school that he once attended on scholarship. His students and fellow teachers despise him for his strict grading and stubborn personality. Dr. Woodrup, Barton's headmaster and Hunham's former student, scolds him for costing the academy money by flunking a major donor's son, causing Princeton University to rescind his offer of admission. As punishment, Hunham is forced to supervise five students left on campus during the Christmas holiday break, including Angus Tully, whose mother cancelled a family trip to Saint Kitts to instead honeymoon with her new husband. Also staying behind is cafeteria manager Mary Lamb, whose late son, Curtis, attended Barton and recently died in the Vietnam War after being drafted . Unlike most Barton students, Curtis did not get a student deferment because he could not afford to go to college. To the students' chagrin, Hunham forces them to study and exercise on their break. After six days, a student's wealthy father arrives by helicopter and agrees to take all five students on the family's ski trip with their parents' permission. Angus, unable to reach his parents for permission, is left alone at Barton with Hunham and Mary. When Hunham catches Angus trying to book a hotel room, the two argue about Hunham's disciplinarian policies. Angus runs through the school halls and defiantly leaps into a pile of gym equipment, dislocating his shoulder. Hunham takes Angus to the hospital. To protect Hunham from blame, Angus lies to the doctors about the circumstances of his injury. At a restaurant, Hunham and Angus encounter Lydia Crane, Woodrup's assistant. Hunham flirts with Lydia, who invites the pair to her Christmas Eve party. Angus, Hunham, Mary, and Barton's janitor, Danny, attend Lydia's party. There, Angus and Lydia's niece Elise share a kiss, while Hunham discovers that Lydia has a boyfriend. As Mary gets drunk and has an emotional breakdown over Curtis's death, Hunham insists on leaving early. As Hunham and Angus argue, Angus says that his father is dead and Mary scolds Hunham for his unsympathetic behavior. Feeling remorseful, Hunham arranges a small Christmas celebration. Mary persuades Hunham to grant Angus's wish for a \"field trip\" to Boston . After dropping off Mary in Roxbury to spend time with her pregnant sister, Angus and Hunham walk through Boston, ice skate and visit the Museum of Fine Arts . The two encounter a classmate of Hunham's from Harvard College , who has become a successful academic. Hunham lies about his career, and Angus plays along. Angus learns that Hunham was expelled from Harvard after a legacy donor's son accused him of plagiarism and Hunham semi-deliberately hit him with a car. Although the incident nearly ruined Hunham's career prospects, the old Barton headmaster took pity on him and offered him an adjunct teaching job. When Hunham and Angus see a movie at the Orpheum Theatre , Angus sneaks away and Hunham catches him entering a taxi. Angus explains that he wants to see his father, and Hunham agrees to accompany him, assuming that they are going to a cemetery. However, Angus's father is alive and confined in a psychiatric hospital . Following the visit, Angus (who takes medication for depression ) expresses concern that his future behavior will echo his father's. Hunham comforts Angus, affirming that Angus is not the same person as his father. Hunham, Angus, Mary and Danny celebrate New Year's Eve together. In January, when school resumes, Hunham is summoned to Woodrup's office; Angus's mother and stepfather are there. They tell Hunham that Angus is not allowed to see his father and that a snowglobe Angus gave to him led to a violent outburst. Angus's mother and stepfather threaten to withdraw Angus from Barton and send him to a military academy .

Her tutor, Prof. Perot is sympathetic and, finding that she has no friends or family in Paris, invites her to a soirée his wife is throwing for a \"few friends\" (primarily professors and their wives). Among the many guests is physicist Pierre Curie , an extremely shy and absentminded man completely devoted to his work. He allows Marie to share his lab and finds that she is a gifted scientist. Appalled that she plans on returning to Poland to teach after graduation rather than devoting her life to further study, he takes her to visit his family in their country home. Marie and Pierre both tend to concentrate on science to the extent that they don't realize until the last minute they have fallen in love. Even when Pierre asks Marie to be his wife, he does so in terms of reason, logic and chemistry. Fascinated by a demonstration she saw as an undergraduate, of a pitchblende rock that seems to generate enough energy to take small photographs, Marie decides to make the rock's energy the subject of her doctoral study. The measurements she takes don't seem to add up, and she decides there must be a  third radioactive element in the rock in addition to the two she knows are in it. In the midst of discussing this, she discloses offhandedly to Pierre's family that she is pregnant. The physics department at the Sorbonne refuses to fund their research without more proof of the element's existence, but allows them to use a dilapidated old shed across the courtyard from the physics building. In spite of its disadvantages, they import eight tons of pitchblende ore and cook it down to look for the element they call radium . In spite of the inability to separate pure radium, they know something is definitely there, as Marie's hands are being burned. They hit on a tedious method of crystallization to isolate pure radium.  After four years, they find only a stain on the bottom of the dish that should have held the radium.  They return to the shed that night and find the dish glowing, confirming that they have isolated the radium. Now world-famous, they go on vacation to rest after all the press conferences and the Nobel Prize . They're granted a new laboratory by the university; before its dedication, Marie shows off her new dress, inspiring Pierre to get her a set of earrings to go with it. Walking home in the rain, he absentmindedly crosses the street in front of a delivery wagon, and he is run down and killed. Marie almost loses her mind, but after the concerned Prof. Perot counsels her, she remembers Pierre's words that if one of them is gone, the other must go on working just the same.

    "plot": "In the late 1890s, a young Cappadocian Greek , Stavros Topouzoglou, lives in an impoverished village below Mount Erciyes in Ottoman Turkey . The subjugated life of the Cappadocian Greeks and Armenians of Kayseri is depicted, including the Derinkuyu Underground City traditional cliff cave dwellings, where Stavros' grandmother lives. Stavros and his Armenian friend Vartan plan to go to the faraway land of opportunity – America – together. Stavros witnesses a Hamidian massacre against the Armenians, which leaves Vartan dead, [ 1 ] and Stavros is nearly imprisoned trying to recover Vartan's mutilated corpse. Knowing that the Greeks won't remain safe from the violent pogroms forever, the family plans to send Stavros to Constantinople , the Ottoman capital, to eventually settle the family there. He is entrusted by his father, Issac, with the family's entire fortune in money, jewels, rugs, whatever is greatest in value and transportable, including the family donkey. Once successful, he is to send first for his sisters, then his brothers, and establish them safely and prosperously there as well.  To do this he will invest in the carpet business of his father's cousin Odysseus by buying his way in with his family's meager accumulated wealth. Though this is his father's dream, it is not Stavros' as he is still determined to go to America. Stavros' odyssey begins with a long voyage on donkey and on foot through the impoverished towns and villages of the Anatolian countryside. Along the way, the naïve young dreamer is robbed of everything, kills the thief in retribution, and arrives at his cousin's home penniless. The older man, who had deceived Stavros' father, is deeply disappointed, as he was counting on Issac's wealth to rescue his failing carpet business. In an attempt to exploit a valuable opportunity Stavros still represents to him, Odysseus proposes that his handsome young cousin marry the plain and needy Thomna, daughter of a wealthy Greek carpet merchant, Aleko Sinnikoglou. Stavros realizes this would mean the end of his dream and adamantly refuses, abruptly leaving the angry cousin. Now homeless on the streets, Stavros survives by eating discarded food and working at backbreaking and hazardous jobs. He is befriended by a streetwise older man, Garabet, who helps him toward his dream.  After nine months of scrimping and self-denial, Stavros has saved nine Turkish pounds towards the 110 pound third class passage to New York, but he has every penny thieved by a prostitute in his first sexual encounter. Clinging to Garabet, he ends up at a gathering of local anarchists planning a terrorist bombing. However, before they can disburse, they are slaughtered by police gunfire.  Left for dead, Stavros ends up in a hospital, only to be thrown atop a wagon filled with dead bodies headed for disposal in the sea. He accidentally slides off and all but crawls back to his cousin's. Odysseus takes pity on the young man and allows him to recover at his home. Broken for the moment, Stavros agrees to marry his intended bride. Before the ceremony she questions his sullen silence, and he admits that he still plans to emigrate to America by using her dowry money to buy a ticket as soon as he can slip away after they are wed. At this point Stavros becomes reacquainted with Hohannes, a young Armenian whom he had aided with food and clothing before his original voyage to Constantinople. Hohannes informs him that he is being sponsored to America by an employer seeking indentured labor , two years' worth in return for passage. By good fortune, Stavros begins an affair with Sophia, the sexually neglected, middle-aged wife of wealthy Armenian-American rug merchant Artoon Kebabian, a client of his prospective father-in-law.  Using money from Sophia, Stavros buys a ticket to New York and leaves Thomna heartbroken, without a word.  He ends up on the same ship as the Kebabians, he in steerage, they in first class. On the other side of the Atlantic the ship lies just offshore of New York City waiting to clear quarantine. Sophia sends her servant to fetch Stavros, and the two have a tryst while Artoon sleeps.  He awakes, discovers the affair, and taunts Stavros, who responds by physically attacking Kebabian.  Stavros is arrested and sentenced by the ship's captain to be returned to Turkey. Hohannes, who is scarcely able to pass inspection by the visiting immigration doctor by hiding his advanced tuberculosis , realizes Stavros will die if he is sent back, and he will die anyway.  Returning his friend's generosity, he jumps off the ship to his death.  Now short a man, the prospective American employer simply allows Stavros to assume Hohannes' identity and slip past immigration officials on Ellis Island , gifted a straw boater by Sophia and a new 'American' name by the chief inspector, \"Joe Arness\". In return, even though he had paid his own passage, “Joe” will have to work off Hohannes' debt by shining shoes, earning only his tips. A closing voiceover reveals that Joe was able to succeed in New York, and one by one brought every family member over – but his father, who, last in the line, died before his chance came.",

The King ignores her objections and introduces her to his head wife, Lady Thiang. Anna also meets a recent concubine , a young Burmese , Tuptim, and the fifteen children she will tutor, including his son and heir, Prince Chulalongkorn . In conversation with the other wives, Anna learns Tuptim is in love with Lun Tha, who brought her to Siam. Anna still wants her own house and teaches the children about the virtues of home life; to the irritation of the King, who disapproves of the influence of other cultures. She comes across Lun Tha and learns that he has been meeting Tuptim in secret. He asks her to arrange a rendezvous. The lovers meet under cover of darkness, and Lun Tha promises he will one day return to Siam and that they will escape together. King Mongkut becomes troubled over rumors that the British regard him as a barbaric leader and are sending a delegation, including Anna's old admirer, Sir Edward, possibly to turn Siam into a protectorate. Anna persuades the King to receive them in European style by hosting a banquet with European food and music. In return, the King promises to give Anna her own house. Sir Edward reminisces with Anna in an attempt to bring her back to British society. The King presents Tuptim's version of Uncle Tom's Cabin as a traditional Siamese ballet . However, the King and the Kralahome are not impressed, as the play involves slavery and shows the slaveholding King drowning in the river. During the show, Tuptim leaves the room to run away with Lun Tha. After the guests have departed, the King reveals that Tuptim is missing. Anna explains that Tuptim is unhappy, because she is just another woman in his eyes. The King retorts that men are entitled to a plenitude of wives, although women must remain faithful. Anna explains that a man should love only one woman, and recalls her first dance before she teaches the King how to dance the polka, but the touching moment is shattered when the Kralahome bursts into the room with the news Tuptim has been caught. For her dishonor, the King prepares to whip her despite Anna's pleas. When Anna declares he is indeed a barbarian, the King crumples and runs out of the room. The Kralahome blames Anna for ruining him, while Tuptim is led away in tears after learning Lun Tha was found dead and dumped into the river. That causes Anna to sever all ties as a governess and declare she will leave Siam on the next boat. On the night of her departure, Anna imagines Tuptim singing 'getting to know you', when Louie tells her they'll be late for their boat. She then later finds out that the King is dying. Lady Thiang hands Anna the King's unfinished letter to her, stating his deep gratitude and respect for her despite their differences. Moments before the ship departs, he gives Anna his ring, as she has always spoken the truth to him, and persuades her and Louis to stay in Bangkok. He passes his title to Prince Chulalongkorn, who then issues a proclamation that states that all subjects will no longer bow down to him but will still respect him.

Mame is flamboyant and exuberant, hosting frequent parties with a variety of guests and free-spirited friends, including the frequently drunk actress Vera Charles; Acacius Page, who runs a progressive school with nudist exercises; and Lindsay Woolsey, a book publisher and devoted suitor. Quickly becoming maternal toward Patrick, Mame aims to give him as broad a view of life as possible. Patrick's inheritance is managed by Dwight Babcock, a trustee of the highly conservative Knickerbocker Bank, who was appointed in Edwin's will to restrain Mame's liberal influence. Without Babcock's knowledge, Mame enrolls Patrick in Page's school. When this is discovered, Babcock forcibly enrolls Patrick into his own alma mater boarding school, preventing Mame from seeing her nephew except during holidays and the summer. When Mame is bankrupted by the 1929 stock market crash , she tries acting with Vera, but Mame's overacting to enhance a small role causes a debacle. She then takes a series of jobs which end disastrously. During one job as a Macy's salesgirl, Mame meets Southern oil baron Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, who seeks her out to relieve her distress when she is fired due to her ineptitude on his large toy order to orphans. Both are smitten, and Beau invites Mame to his estate, where his erstwhile fiancée, Sally Cato MacDougall, makes an attempt on Mame's life by maneuvering her onto an unmanageable horse. Mame and Beauregard are married, travelling around the world on an extensive honeymoon. Mame continues to exchange letters with Patrick, indicating Babcock is influencing him into a more conventional personality, and Patrick joins them periodically. After Beau dies while climbing the Matterhorn in 1937, Mame, now a rich widow, comes home after a prolonged period of mourning to discover the now-adult Patrick has given her a dictaphone, typewriter, and secretary, Agnes Gooch. He, Vera, and Lindsay persuade Mame to write her autobiography but arrange for a collaborator/ ghostwriter , Brian O'Bannion, who rapidly proves to be a fortune hunter. Patrick announces to Mame that he is engaged to Gloria Upson, a girl approved by Babcock from a \" restricted \" community in Connecticut called Mountebank. Initially angered by the change in Patrick's character, Mame relents to please him. She also sabotages O'Bannion's attempted wooing by sending Agnes to a party in her place, lying to O'Bannion that Agnes is a secret heiress. When an inebriated Agnes returns, she barely remembers the evening; she thinks they saw a movie with a wedding scene and that O'Bannion was keen to meet her mother but abandoned her on the way to the working-class neighborhood. After meeting Gloria, who proves to be spoiled and bigoted, Mame visits Gloria's parents in Mountebank at their house, \"Upson Downs\". Finding them boorish and anti-Semitic, Mame invites them and Gloria to a dinner party at her apartment with Patrick, Babcock, and an assortment of friends. On the night of the party, Patrick meets Mame's new secretary, Pegeen, and the two are attracted to each other; Agnes also lives there, now pregnant due to her night with O'Bannion and presumed to be unmarried. The entire party is choreographed to show up the Upsons: Lindsay surprises the attendees with galleys from Mame's autobiography, reminding Patrick of forgotten adventures. The book's release prompts a telegram from O'Bannion demanding half the royalties for his efforts, also revealing that he married Agnes on their night out. When Gloria insults Mame's company, Patrick instead defends them and insults Gloria's own circle, ending their relationship. To the Upsons' horror, Mame dedicates her royalties to a home for refugee Jewish children to be built adjoining the Upson property in Mountebank. The Upsons leave in a huff. Mame berates Babcock for his attempts to manipulate Patrick's life; he also leaves. By 1946, Patrick and Pegeen are married and have a son, Michael. Mame and Michael persuade his parents to let Mame take the child on a journey to India, and the movie fades as Mame tells Michael of all the wondrous sights they will see.",

    "plot": "Reporter Jack Burden is sent on assignment to write about Willie Stark, a man running for county treasurer in an unnamed Southern state . Stark's campaign is run on honesty and talking about the corruption of the local politicians. Burden meets Stark and his family and writes an inspiring story on Stark's honesty and courage. Using their power, including sway over the police, the local political machine shuts out Stark. After his loss, Stark earns a law degree. When a shoddily-constructed school in his county experiences a structural collapse that kills 12 students during a fire drill, Stark is encouraged to work on their legal affairs at the children's funeral, and he ultimately wins a lawsuit against the county, leading to a state-wide investigation. Willie uses this to build his political momentum, and he is eventually drafted as a spoiler candidate for Governor by the frontrunner in a three-way race. Stark embarks on the campaign trail with Sadie Burke, an associate of the campaign installed as a mole from a rival candidate, and Burden. Initially Stark has trouble on the campaign trail as he speaks obtusely and plainly about his balanced budget plan for the state. However, once Burke reveals he is just a spoiler candidate , Stark begins to give more impassioned and effective speeches. During this time, Burden continues to report on Stark's campaign, but he resigns after being told to stop writing positively about Stark. Ultimately Stark loses the race, but draws large grassroots support from the rural areas of the state as he identifies as one of them – a fooled \" hick .\" Over the next four years, Stark realizes how to win and continues to campaign and make backroom deals to gain political influence and campaign funds. Meanwhile, Burden has had a tough time finding another job, but is hired by Stark to serve as an opposition researcher for the campaign. Stark and Burden go back to Burden's home to convince Burden's friends and family to support the campaign. Skeptical of Stark's alleged deals and big promises, Adam, brother of Jack Burden's girlfriend, Anne Stanton, asks questions and is not fully convinced. However, Anne sensing his demagogic magnetism believes fully in Stark's message. Burden gets the group on board by promising State Attorney General to Anne's uncle, the honest Judge Stanton. Willie ends up winning the election in a landslide and is portrayed by newsreels as either a prairie messiah or incipient dictator. During his time as Governor, Stark ends up utilizing his power in aggressive and corrupt ways as Burden develops a black book of biographical leverage to extract political favors and votes in support of their agenda. He covers up a scandal by a member of his administration, after which Judge Stanton resigns as Attorney General and publicly asserts Stark's corruption. Stark's loss of morals, corruption, and alienation from his small-town self is exacerbated as he philanders with many women, including Anne and Sadie. Feeling the pressure of his father's status, Stark's adopted college-aged son Tommy drinks to deal with his feelings about his father. Following a football practice where Stark berates Tommy for drinking, Tommy gets drunk and crashes his car, injuring himself and killing his female passenger. To combat the bad press, Stark pressures Tommy into a game despite him not being fully recovered. During the game, Tommy takes a rough hit and is rushed to the hospital. Stark, blaming himself for Tommy's injury, begs Adam, a surgeon, to do all he can. Adam, preferring to wait for a specialist, ultimately agrees to operate after Stark clumsily tries to entice him by offering to build a new hospital for the public. Tommy ends up a paraplegic . Following this, Burden gives Anne evidence of Judge Stanton's possible past wrongdoing that Burden has buried out of respect for the judge's lifetime career. Stark begins his re-election campaign for Governor by visiting his estranged family. While there, Judge Stanton publicly blames Stark for the suspicious death of the father of the girl in Tommy's car accident after the father refused Stark's bribe to make it go away. An impeachment trial is brought against Stark and the judge controls how certain senators will vote at the trial. Stark issues orders to \"turn the yokels out\" to demonstrate in his support and there are concerns that he might use the state militia to remain in power. In desperation, Stark visits Judge Stanton and attempts to strongarm him to release his senators with the evidence that Burden found, given to him by Anne. However, Judge Stanton commits suicide , and the impeachment ends with Stark's acquittal . During Stark's public victory celebration, Adam distraught over the pressure put on the judge mortally shoots Stark, believing that the only reason he was appointed as the director for the hospital was that his sister was Willie Stark's mistress. Having lost his respect for Stark, Burden tries to get Anne's agreement to find a way to destroy Stark's reputation following his death. Stark dies on the steps of the state capitol bemoaning his stolen opportunity for greatness and wondering why it happened to him.",

    "plot": "In the 1980s in Boston , Irish Mob boss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan. Many years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a spy inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam to go undercover as a criminal and infiltrate Costello's crew. Costigan serves a term in prison for his cover and further commits several crimes, drawing Costello's attention. Sullivan begins dating police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan manages to get Costello to recruit him into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved. His mental state declines, but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins seeing Madden for his court-ordered therapy. The MSP and Costello both realize they have moles in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find them. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected FBI informant , sharing his discovery with Queenan. He and Madden have an affair. One night, Costigan follows Costello into an adult theater and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information on his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but is unsuccessful. When Sullivan realizes he is being followed, he stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Costigan, fearing Costello will soon discover and kill him for being the mole, calls Queenan to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls Costello's gang to inform them of the meeting. When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between the police and Costello's men. In the wake of Queenan's murder, both men (Dignam and Sullivan) fight and Dignam is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the mole before succumbing to his wounds. Looking through Queenan's belongings, Sullivan discovers Costello is an FBI informant. A news report reveals that Delahunt was a Boston Police Department undercover officer, but Costello suspects it is a false claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him. His assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, unaware he is another mole. After Sullivan leaves the room, Costigan recognises the envelope from the theater on his desk. Realizing Sullivan was Costello's mole, Costigan escapes. When Sullivan finds Costigan gone, he realizes Costigan has discovered the truth and deletes Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has told Sullivan but not Costigan she's pregnant, knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. Madden finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan to Sullivan containing a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Fearing Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to it and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the same rooftop where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the police academy, but Brown pulls a gun on him when he arrives, unsure who to believe. Saying he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, Brown lets Costigan take the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot dead by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who is another of Costello's spies. Brown reaches the lobby but is also killed by Barrigan. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, so that he can frame him as the only mole. At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices Madden silently crying. He realizes they were involved, but when he attempts to talk to her about the baby, she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him, and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, killing him before leaving.",

They drive to the Villa Eden, which Anita shares with Frances, the longtime secretary of American author John Frederick Shadwell, an expatriate living in Rome. On their way into town, the three women stop at the Trevi Fountain . Frances and Anita tell Maria that according to legend, if she throws a coin in the fountain and makes a wish to return to Rome, she will. Maria and Frances throw in their coins, while Anita, who is planning to return to the United States to marry, declines. Anita takes Maria to the agency and introduces her to Giorgio Bianchi, a translator. Maria senses that Anita and Giorgio are attracted to each other, though Anita states that the agency forbids its American and Italian employees to fraternize. Later that evening at a party, Maria becomes smitten with the handsome Prince Dino di Cessi, despite being warned by Frances and Anita of his reputation as a womanizer who is notorious for taking his girlfriends to Venice for romantic trysts. Dino charms Maria, telling her to ignore what she has heard about him. Walking home after the party, Anita confesses to Maria that she has no fiancé but believes she has a better chance of finding a husband in the United States, since wealthy Italian men are not interested in mere secretaries, and the men who are interested are too poor. They later encounter Giorgio, who invites Anita to attend a celebration with him at his family's country farm the next day. Anita reluctantly agrees. The next morning, as Giorgio picks Anita up in his cousin's dilapidated truck, they are spotted by her boss, Burgoyne. On Giorgio's family farm, Giorgio tells Anita that he hopes to become a lawyer, despite his poverty. The couple later give in to their attraction and they kiss. Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Dino asks if Maria will accompany him to Venice. Desiring to see Venice but not wanting to lose Dino's respect, Maria arranges for Frances to chaperone them—to Dino's disappointment. At the agency on Monday, Burgoyne questions Maria about Anita's weekend with Giorgio, and although she maintains that Anita did nothing wrong, Burgoyne assumes Anita is having an affair with Giorgio. The following day, he fires Giorgio. Anita blames Maria for betraying her confidence and insists on moving out of their apartment. She visits Giorgio, worried that she might have ruined his chances of becoming a lawyer. Giorgio has no regrets. Determined to win Dino's affections, Maria collects information about his interests and preferences, including his love of modern art and his favorite food and wine. She also lies about being \"three-quarters Italian\". Beguiled by how much he apparently has in common with Maria, Dino introduces her to his mother, the Principessa, who expresses her approval. When Dino confides in Maria that his mother is the only woman whom he has ever completely trusted, she confesses her subterfuge, showing Dino her notebook listing his interests. He angrily takes her home. Frances meets Anita, who admits that she and Giorgio are in love but will not marry because he is too poor. Frances returns home to comfort the guilt-stricken Maria, who also plans to leave Rome because Dino has not contacted her since her admission. The next morning, Frances suddenly announces to Shadwell that she is returning to the United States, not wanting to end up as an old maid in a foreign country. Shadwell, unaware that Frances has been in love with him for 15 years, offers her a marriage of convenience based on mutual respect, which she accepts. The next day, Shadwell learns that he is terminally ill and has less than a year to live unless he goes to the US for experimental treatment. Shadwell returns to his villa and coldly ends his engagement to Frances. After learning from Shadwell's doctor the truth about his condition, Frances follows him to a café, where they drown their sorrows while bickering about whether he should pursue treatment. After taking an intoxicated Frances back to the villa, Shadwell visits Dino and informs him that he is leaving for the United States, where he will marry Frances. Shadwell uses reverse psychology to convince Dino that he loves Maria. After Anita and Maria are packed and ready to leave, Frances telephones and asks to meet them at the Trevi Fountain. There, Maria and Anita are disappointed to see the fountain emptied for cleaning. When they are joined by Frances, however, the water springs up again, much to the women's excitement.

    "plot": "In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demand the resignation of British prime minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Conservative Party colleagues want Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not feel it is his time. Chamberlain chooses the only man whom the opposition will accept as leader of a national government : Winston Churchill , who had correctly predicted the danger from Adolf Hitler before the war but has a poor reputation in Parliament. As Germany invades the Low Countries, Churchill is brusque with his new secretary Elizabeth Layton for mishearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine . King George VI , who is sceptical of Churchill due to his actions during the abdication crisis , reluctantly invites him to form a government . Churchill includes Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council and Halifax as Foreign Secretary . Parliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising \" Blood, toil, tears, and sweat \". Chamberlain and Halifax are appalled by Churchill's refusal to negotiate for peace, and plan to resign from the government to force a vote of no confidence and create a situation in which Halifax would likely become prime minister. Churchill visits French prime minister Paul Reynaud , who thinks that Churchill is delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France , while Churchill is furious that the French do not have a plan to counterattack. Although US president Franklin Roosevelt is sympathetic to Churchill's plight, his actions are limited by an isolationist Congress and the Neutrality Acts . Churchill draws ire from his cabinet and advisers for delivering a radio address in which he falsely implies the Allies are advancing in France, earning him a rebuke from the king. Halifax and Chamberlain continue to push to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as an intermediary with Germany. The British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais , and Britain begins preparing for a German invasion . Against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade to distract the enemy and buy time for the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk. The debacle in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace but chokes on the words as he tries to dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill, explaining that he has come to support Churchill to continue the war. Churchill's idea to have civilian boats evacuate troops from Dunkirk ( Operation Dynamo ) is initiated. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the London Underground (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers for their opinions: they all want to continue to fight. Churchill addresses the Outer Cabinet and other members of Parliament and finds that they, too, have little desire to surrender. As Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides to first listen to the address. Finishing his speech, Churchill proclaims \" we shall fight on the beaches \", should the Germans invade, to resounding support from the opposition, while the Conservative MPs behind him sit in silence until Chamberlain mops his brow with his handkerchief; a prearranged signal that they should support the PM. Churchill exits to cheers and enthusiastic waving of Order Papers . An epilogue reveals that almost all of the soldiers trapped at Dunkirk were successfully evacuated; Chamberlain died six months later; Halifax was reassigned to a posting in Washington, D.C. , and Churchill was voted out of office after the end of World War II in Europe .",

    "plot": "In 1858, 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous lives in poverty with her family in Lourdes , France. She is shamed by her Catholic school teacher, Sister Vauzou , for falling behind in her studies because of her asthma . That afternoon, while fetching firewood with her sister Marie and a friend, Bernadette waits for them in the Massabielle grotto . Distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light, Bernadette sees a beautiful lady clad in white, standing on a rock niche. Bernadette tells her companions what she saw, and they promise not to tell anyone else. However, Marie tells their mother when they return home, and the story soon spreads all over Lourdes. Many, including Bernadette's Aunt Bernarde, are convinced of her sincerity, standing up for her against her disbelieving parents. Bernadette continues to repeatedly visit the grotto as requested by the lady, accompanied by other citizens of Lourdes. While Abbé Dominique Peyramale refuses to get involved, civil authorities threateningly interrogate Bernadette, but she confounds them with her simplicity and stands behind her story. On one visit, the lady asks Bernadette to drink and wash at a seemingly nonexistent spring. Bernadette obediently digs a hole in the ground and smears her face with dirt. Though she is initially ridiculed, water later begins to flow, which exhibits miraculous healing properties; ailing people soon begin flocking to Lourdes. On Bernadette’s last visit to the grotto, the lady finally identifies herself as the \" Immaculate Conception .\" When civil authorities try to have Bernadette declared insane, Peyramale, who once doubted her, now becomes her staunchest ally and asks for a formal church investigation to verify if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or genuine. The grotto is fenced off, and the Bishop of Tarbes declares that unless the Emperor orders the grotto to open, there will be no investigation. When The Emperor’s infant son is cured of his illness by water from Lourdes, the Empress demands that the grotto be reopened. The Bishop of Tarbes then directs the commission to convene. The investigation takes many years, and Bernadette is questioned again and again, but the commission eventually determines that Bernadette truly experienced the visions and was visited by the Virgin Mary . Believing it unsuitable for her to live an ordinary life, Peyramale persuades Bernadette to join the Sisters of Charity of Nevers . Bernadette undergoes rigorous spiritual training and works hard at the convent but is also subjected to emotional abuse from Sister Vauzou, now mistress of novices at the convent. Vauzou tells Bernadette that doubt consumes her, and that she cannot believe that Bernadette, who has never suffered, would be chosen by God when she has spent her life suffering in his service. Though Bernadette agrees that she has not suffered, she then reveals a tumor hidden under the skirt of her habit, much to Vauzou’s horror. The doctor diagnoses tuberculosis of the bone; the condition causes unspeakable pain, yet Bernadette had never mentioned it. Vauzou, realizing her error, prays for forgiveness and vows to serve Bernadette for the rest of her life. Despite the severity of her illness, Bernadette refuses to partake of the grotto’s healing waters. On her deathbed, Bernadette sends for Peyramale and confesses her feelings of unworthiness while sorrowfully maintaining that she may never see the lady again. However, the lady appears in the room, smiles, and gestures to Bernadette warmly. Bernadette joyfully cries out to the apparition before finally dying. Upon her death, Peyramale remarks, \"You are now in Heaven and on earth. Your life begins, O Bernadette.\"",

    "plot": "In 1976, at a Boston Police station, two policemen discuss the arrest of Fr. John Geoghan for child molestation . A high-ranking cleric talks to the mother of the victims, assuring her that Geoghan will no longer work at her parish and asking her to keep quiet for the sake of the Church. An assistant district attorney visits the precinct and tells the policemen to keep the arrest secret from the press. The mother declines to press charges and Geoghan is quietly released. In 2001, Marty Baron , the new managing editor of The Boston Globe , meets Walter \"Robby\" Robinson , the editor of the newspaper's \"Spotlight\" investigative team . Baron is neither Catholic nor a Bostonian, and looks for ways to shake up the paper—even if it means antagonizing the powerful Archdiocese of Boston . After Baron reads a Globe article about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian , charging that Cardinal Bernard Law , the Archbishop of Boston , knew about Geoghan's sexual abuse of children and did nothing to stop it, Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines to be interviewed. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team and convinces Garabedian to talk. The Spotlight team initially believes that they are following the story of one priest who was repeatedly reassigned to different parishes , but deduces that many other priests in Massachusetts have been similarly shuttled from parish to parish, suggesting a broader cover-up. With advice from Phil Saviano , who heads the victims' rights group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), the team widens their search to thirteen priests. Richard Sipe , a psychotherapist who used to treat sexually abusive priests referred to him by the Church, estimates that there are roughly 90 abusive priests in Boston (6% of priests). The team develops a list of 87 names and interviews many of their victims. As the team realizes the sheer scale of the investigation, it begins to take a toll on their lives. Matt Carroll learns that near his home, the Archdiocese quietly maintains a facility that houses and psychologically treats abusive priests, but to avoid spoiling the story, he cannot tell his neighbors; Sacha Pfeiffer finds herself unable to attend church with her grandmother; Rezendes pushes to get the story out quickly to prevent rival newspapers from preemptively publishing under-researched work that the Archdiocese can explain away; and Robinson's network of affluent Catholic friends pressures him to compromise the investigation to protect the Church. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team members are temporarily reassigned to cover terrorism. The investigation restarts when Garabedian informs Rezendes that there are publicly available court documents tying the cover-up to Cardinal Law himself, including a letter from Bishop D'Arcy warning Law of Geoghan's reputation. Robinson urges the team to continue researching the case, emphasizing that Law can write off a few priests as bad apples and that the Church's systematic cover-ups must be exposed. After a (Catholic) judge grants the Globe 's motion to unseal more legal filings supporting the existence of a cover-up, the Spotlight team finally begins to write the story, which is scheduled for January 2002. Before the story runs, Robinson confesses that in 1993, before he joined the Spotlight team, plaintiffs' attorney Eric MacLeish gave him a list of 20 sexually abusive priests, but he ran only a minor story and never followed up. He did not remember the list until Spotlight began investigating the Archdiocese. Baron acknowledges that reporters do not always get it right and commends Robinson and his team for exposing the crimes now. The story runs with a web link to the documents exposing Law's cover-up and a hotline for victims of abusive priests. The next morning, the team is inundated with calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. A textual epilogue notes that Law resigned in December 2002 and was eventually promoted to the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome , and presents a list of 105 U.S. communities and 101 others around the world where major scandals involving abuse by priests have taken place.",

    "plot": "A bay Irish Hunter is born in Devon , England in 1912. Farmer Ted Narracott outbids his landlord Lyons for the colt at auction, to the dismay of his wife Rose who wanted a working horse that can plough, not an Irish Hunter. Their son Albert, with his best friend Andrew, names the colt Joey, and teaches him to come when he imitates an owl's call. The horse and boy, now closely bonded, plough a rocky field, permitting the planting of turnips and saving the family's farm. Rose shows Albert his father's medals, including a Distinguished Conduct Medal , from the Second Boer War , and gives him Ted's regimental pennant , confiding in Albert that his father carries physical and mental scars from the war. When war with Germany is declared in 1914, heavy rain ruins the family's crops, forcing Ted to sell Joey to an army officer, Captain James Nicholls, who sees Albert's heartbreak and promises to look after Joey. Albert is too young to enlist, and ties the pennant to Joey's bridle, promising he will eventually find him. Joey bonds with Topthorn, a black stallion with whom he is trained for his military role. The horses are deployed to Flanders with a flying column under the command of Nicholls and Major Stewart. They lead a cavalry charge through a German encampment defended by hidden machine guns . Nicholls and most of the cavalrymen are killed and the Germans capture the horses. Gunther, a young volunteer, grooms Joey and Topthorn. When his younger brother Michael is sent to the front lines, Gunther deserts with his brother on the horses. The German army captures the boys and executes them, leaving the horses unattended. They are found by Emilie, a French girl, the next morning, and she hides them from German soldiers in her bedroom at her grandfather's farm. Emilie's grandfather allows her to ride Joey for her birthday, but they are discovered and captured by the Germans while Emilie's grandfather keeps the pennant. By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the Second Battle of the Somme where Andrew is killed and Albert temporarily blinded by an exploding gas bomb. The Germans use Joey and Topthorn to haul artillery under the care of Private Friedrich Hengelmann. Topthorn succumbs to exhaustion from overwork and dies. Devastated over this loss, Hengelmann rebels against his commanders and frees Joey from his reins. Joey gallops into no man's land and evades a tank but is entangled in barbed wire. Colin, a British soldier, makes his way to Joey under a white flag and tries to free him. Peter, a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they rescue Joey. They flip a coin for ownership of the horse, and Colin guides the injured Joey to the British lines. Albert hears about Joey's rescue while recuperating. Just as Joey is about to be put down by a doctor who deems the horse too injured to recover, Joey hears Albert's owl call. Albert, his eyes still bandaged, is able to describe Joey in perfect detail, and the two are reunited. The doctor nurses Joey back to health. After the Great War ends Joey is put up for auction. Albert's comrades raise a collection to bid against a wealthy French butcher. Emilie's grandfather wins the auction, implying she has died and the horse is all he has left of her. After Albert pleads with him, the old man recognises the strength of the soldier's bond, returning the pennant and Joey to Albert. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, embracing his mother and returning the pennant to his father, who extends his hand to him with pride as Joey watches.",

    "plot": "\"The following is based on a true story. It began October 6, 1970 in Istanbul, Turkey .\" On vacation in Istanbul , American college student Billy Hayes straps 2 kg (4.4 lb) of hashish bricks to his chest. As he and his girlfriend Susan are about to board a plane back to the US, Billy is frisked by soldiers (who are on high alert for terrorist attacks) who discover the drug. Billy is then arrested by the police and strip-searched. A shadowy American — whom Billy nicknames \"Tex\" for his thick Texan accent — arrives and accompanies Billy to a police station and translates for him. Billy claims he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver. He offers to help police locate the driver in exchange for being released. At a nearby market, Billy points out the driver to police, who approach him; meanwhile Billy attempts to escape, only to be recaptured at gunpoint by Tex. During his first night in Sultanahmet Jail , a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. He is later rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. A few days later, Billy awakens in Sağmalcılar Prison , surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who stole two candlesticks from a mosque ), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swedish drug smuggler). Jimmy warns Billy that the prison is dangerous for foreigners and says no one can be trusted, not even young children. Billy meets with his father, a U.S. representative, and a Turkish lawyer to discuss his situation. During Billy's trial, the prosecutor makes a case against him for drug smuggling. The lead judge is sympathetic to Billy and gives him a four-year sentence for drug possession. Billy and his father are devastated, but their Turkish lawyer insists it is a good result because the prosecutor wanted a life sentence . Jimmy wants Billy to join an escape attempt through the prison's subterranean tunnels. Billy, due to be released soon, declines. Jimmy goes alone and is caught, then brutally beaten. Fifty-three days before his release, Billy learns the Turkish High Court in Ankara has overturned his sentence after an appeal by the prosecution. The prosecutor who originally wanted Billy convicted of smuggling rather than the lesser charge of possession finally had his way. Billy has been resentenced to serve 30 years. In desperation, Billy accompanies Jimmy and Max to try to escape through the catacombs below the prison. They give up after running into endless dead-ends. A particularly sycophantic prisoner, Rifki, who routinely acts as an informant in exchange for favors, notifies the guards about the escape attempt. Hamidou suspects Jimmy of being responsible for what happened during the first escape attempt. Jimmy is taken away again for punishment and is never seen again. Billy's imprisonment becomes harsh and brutal: terrifying scenes of physical and mental torture follow one another, and Billy has a breakdown. He brutally beats Rifki, killing him. He is sent to the prison's ward for the insane, where he wanders about in a daze among the other disturbed prisoners. Max is sent there, too. He is seen running from guards for an unknown infraction and is grabbed by Hamidou and severely injured. In 1975, Billy's girlfriend Susan visits him. Devastated by Billy's condition, she tells him he must get out or die. She leaves him a scrapbook with money hidden inside to help Billy escape. Her visit strongly helps Billy to regain his senses. Billy says goodbye to an almost dead Max, telling him to stay alive and promising he will come back for him. Max awakens and is somewhat conscious. Billy tries to bribe Hamidou to take him to the prison hospital, but instead Hamidou forces Billy to a room, then tries to rape him. Billy becomes infuriated. They struggle until Hamidou is killed after being pushed into the wall, his head impaled upon a coat hook. Billy dons the guard's uniform and bluffs his way with his Turkish language skills, walks out of the front door and runs to freedom. \"On the night of October 4th, 1975 Billy Hayes successfully crossed the border to Greece. He arrived home at Kennedy Airport 3 weeks later.\"",

    "plot": "The film covers the years 1529 to 1535, during the reign of Henry VIII . During a private late-night meeting at Hampton Court , Cardinal Wolsey , Lord Chancellor of England , chastises More for being the only member of the privy council to oppose Wolsey's attempts to obtain from the Pope an annulment of Henry VIII 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon , as their marriage has not produced a male heir. With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry Anne Boleyn , with whom he hopes to father such an heir and avoid a repeat of the Wars of the Roses . More says that he cannot agree to Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is being overheard by Wolsey's aide, Thomas Cromwell . Returning to his home at Chelsea at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance Richard Rich waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More instead offers Rich a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's offer, saying that teaching would offer him little chance to become well known. More finds his daughter Meg chatting with a brilliant young lawyer, William Roper , who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly Catholic More says he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a Lutheran . Wolsey is dismissed from office when the annulment is not granted and dies in disgrace in a rural monastery. More succeeds him as Lord Chancellor. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate and again requests More's support for an annulment, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. Cromwell, now the King's Principal Secretary , bribes Rich with the promise of a position at Court if he will spy on More. Roper, learning of More's quarrel with the king, says that his religious views have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the king has become \"the Devil's minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich again pleads for More to grant him an office. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Cromwell. An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\" A humiliated Rich ends his friendship with More. Meanwhile, the king orders Parliament and the bishops to declare him \" Supreme Head of the Church of England \". Embracing Caesaropapism , the bishops and Parliament accede to the king's demands and renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend and successor, Thomas Howard , attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over. In a meeting with Norfolk, Cromwell implies that More's troubles will be over if he will attend the king's \"wedding\" to Boleyn. After More does not, he is summoned again to Hampton Court and interrogated mercilessly by Cromwell. More refuses to answer any questions, and an infuriated Cromwell sends him away. The Thames boatmen are aware of the King's hostility to More and refuse to ferry him, so More returns home on foot. As More finally arrives, his daughter Meg informs him that a new oath is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of high treason . Initially, More says he might be willing to take the oath, depending on its wording. Upon learning that it names the king as head of the Church, legitimizes his Lutheran heirs, and allows no legal or moral loopholes, More refuses to take it and is imprisoned in the Tower of London . At an inquiry chaired by Cromwell and Norfolk, More remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the king's supremacy. Cromwell punishes More by having his prized collection of books confiscated. As Rich collects the books, he and his former friend share a final debate over More's choices. More says goodbye to his wife Alice , Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him, but to leave the country. At his trial, More refuses to express an opinion about the king's second marriage or why he will not take the Oath, based upon the legal principle that silence is to be interpreted as consent . Cromwell calls Rich to testify. Rich alleges that, when he went to confiscate More's books, More told him that while Parliament has the power to dethrone the king, it does not have the authority to make the king the Head of the Church. A horrified More offers to take any oath required by the court that he never said any such thing to Rich. More adds that he would never be so suicidal as to entrust so dangerous an opinion \"to such a man as that.\" As Rich leaves the witness box, it emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for Wales as a reward from Cromwell for committing perjury , much to More's chagrin. Under a direct order from Cromwell, the jury convicts More without leaving the courtroom to deliberate. But as the judges begin to pronounce the death penalty , More interrupts and reminds them that prisoners are to be asked before sentencing if they have anything to say. Upon being so asked by the judges, More declares, \"I do.\" More calls Parliament's Act of Supremacy repugnant to every legal precedent and institution in all the history of Christendom . He cites the Biblical foundation for the Petrine Primacy and the authority of the Papacy , rather than national governments, over the Church. Furthermore, he declares that the Church's freedom from state control and interference is guaranteed both in the Magna Carta and in the king's own coronation oath. As uproar ensues, the judges sentence More to death by beheading . The scene switches from the court to Tower Hill , where More observes custom by pardoning and tipping the executioner. More declares, \"I die his Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\" He kneels at the block and, off-screen, the executioner cuts off More's head. A narrator intones an epilogue, listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Rich, who \"became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed.\"",

During a private meeting, a high-ranking church official criticizes the government official for being the only council member opposing a royal plan to annul a marriage and marry a new wife in hopes of producing a male heir.\n\nThe government official refuses to support manipulative tactics to pressure religious institutions. Unknown to him, the conversation is overheard by a scheming administrative assistant. At home, the official encounters a young ambitious man seeking a court position, whom he offers a teaching job. The ambitious man declines, wanting more prestigious opportunities.\n\nThe monarch dismisses the church official and replaces him with the principled government official. The king attempts to persuade the official to support his plans but is repeatedly refused.

A key witness—the previously rejected ambitious man—provides damaging testimony, receiving a prestigious governmental position as reward for his perjury.\n\nThe official is convicted and sentenced to death. Before his execution, he delivers a passionate defense of religious independence, citing historical and religious precedents.

    "plot": "On May 11, 1941, boxer and amateur pilot Joe Pendleton, affectionately known as \"the Flying Pug\", flies his small aircraft to his next fight in New York City, but crashes when a control cable severs. His soul is retrieved by 7013, an officious angel who assumed that Joe could not have survived. Joe's manager, Max \"Pop\" Corkle, has his body cremated. In the afterlife , the records show his death was a mistake; he was supposed to live for 50 more years. [ 3 ] The angel's superior, Mr. Jordan, confirms this, but since there is no more body, Joe will have to take over a newly dead corpse . Jordan explains that a body is just something that is worn, like an overcoat; inside, Joe will still be himself. Joe insists that it be someone in good physical shape, because he wants to continue his boxing career. After Joe turns down several \"candidates\", Jordan takes him to see the body of a crooked, extremely wealthy banker and investor named Bruce Farnsworth, who has just been drugged and drowned in a bathtub by his wife Julia and his secretary, Tony Abbott. Joe is reluctant to take over a life so unlike his previous one, but when he sees the murderous pair mockingly berating Bette Logan, whose father's name has been misused by Farnsworth to sell worthless securities, [ 4 ] he changes his mind and agrees to take over Farnsworth's body. [ a ] As Farnsworth, Joe repays all the investors and has Bette's father exonerated. [ 4 ] He sends for Corkle and convinces him that he is Joe (by playing his saxophone just as badly as he did in his previous incarnation). With Farnsworth's money to smooth the way, Corkle trains him and arranges a bout to decide who will next fight the current heavyweight champion, but Jordan returns to warn Joe that, while he is destined to be the champion, it cannot happen that way. Joe has just enough time to tell Bette, with whom he has fallen in love, that if a stranger (especially if he is a boxer) approaches her, to give him a chance. Then he is shot by Tony. While Joe returns to a ghostly existence, Farnsworth's body is hidden, with everyone believing Farnsworth has simply disappeared. Corkle hires a private investigator to find him. Accompanied by Jordan, Joe goes to retrieve his lucky saxophone he left on Farnsworth's piano and finds the police conducting a group interrogation. Corkle, talking to himself, wanders the room looking for Joe or Jordan. Corkle has explained about Joe, Mr. Jordan and the body-switching, to the police detective who thinks he is a nut. Joe manages to mentally nudge Corkle into turning on the radio to hear the championship fight and hears that Murdock has collapsed from a slight grazing punch. Jordan reveals that the boxer was shot by gamblers because he refused to throw the fight. Joe takes over Murdock's body and wins the title. Back at the mansion, Corkle hears one of the radio announcers mention a saxophone hanging by the ringside and seeing the saxophone gone from the room, realizes Joe has assumed Murdock's body. Corkle races down to the dressing room. There, Joe passes along information from Jordan that Farnsworth's body is in a refrigerator in the basement of the mansion. Corkle tells the detective, who promptly has Julia and Tony arrested. As Murdock, Joe fires his old, crooked manager and hires Corkle. Jordan reveals to Joe that this is his destiny; he can be Murdock and live his life. Healing the gunshot wound and at the same time removing Joe's memory of his past life , Jordan hangs around for a bit longer until Bette arrives.

    "plot": "Soon after the Second World War, in the West Riding of Yorkshire , England, Joe Lampton, an ambitious young man, moves from his hometown, the dreary factory town of Dufton, to the somewhat larger town of Warnley to assume a secure but poorly paid and dead-end post in the Borough Treasurer's Department. Determined to get ahead, and ignoring the warnings of his colleague and flatmate Charlie Soames, he pursues Susan Brown, the daughter of a local industrial magnate. She has been dating wealthy Jack Wales but Joe is able to charm her. Mr and Mrs Brown attempt to frustrate Joe's social climbing by persuading Joe's boss to encourage him to pursue a woman of his own class; getting him a job offer back in Dufton, which he refuses when he discovers the machination; and sending Susan on a trip abroad, but Susan remains smitten. While pursuing Susan, Joe continues to see Alice Aisgill, an unhappily married Frenchwoman ten years his senior who came to England as a teacher a decade earlier and married George Aisgill, a haughty and abusive upper-middle class Englishman who is now having numerous affairs. Joe thinks he is just killing time with Alice and Alice says they can just be \"loving friends\". Their feelings for each other begin to turn into something more and Joe starts to lose interest in his pursuit of Susan. The relationship is passionate, tempestuous and after a particularly heated argument, Joe switches his focus back to Susan. He manages to take her virginity but is unsatisfied and finds himself drawn back to Alice. Joe and Alice go away on a short holiday and Alice is overjoyed that Joe seems to have decided to end his quest for wealth and social status in favour of simply being happy with himself and with her. They decide she will ask for a divorce when she gets home but when she does, George refuses and declares he will ruin Joe and Alice, both socially and financially, if their relationship continues. While Joe is brooding over this, Mr Brown delivers the news that Susan is pregnant and that he expects Joe to stop seeing Alice and marry Susan, in which case Joe can come to work for him at a generous salary. Seeing no way around his obstacles to a relationship with Alice, Joe tells her that he is going to marry Susan. Heartbroken, Alice gets drunk in a pub and the next morning, while his co-workers are celebrating his engagement, Joe hears that she drove her car off a cliff to which she and he used to go together and died slowly over the course of several hours. Devastated, Joe leaves the office and wanders to the flat where he and Alice had their trysts but Alice's friend Elspeth, who owns the flat, drives him away by screaming at him and blaming him for Alice's death. Joe goes to a pub on the waterfront, where a woman named Mavis comes on to him because he is well-dressed. Although he is very drunk and does not seem very interested in her (he calls her Alice), Joe keeps a man from taking Mavis away against her will. When Joe is alone, the man and some of his friends beat Joe unconscious. In the morning, Charlie finds Joe lying in the street with a battered face but Joe's only concern is his guilt over what he feels he led Alice to do. A short time later, Joe and Susan get married. With a rich wife and high-paying job, he has got everything he thought he wanted. As they are driven away after the wedding, Susan's effusive praise of the ceremony is cut short when she notices that there are tears in Joe's eyes, which she misinterprets by saying \"I believe you really are sentimental after all\".",

    "plot": "In Hadleyville, a small town in New Mexico Territory , Marshal Will Kane , newly married to Amy Fowler, prepares to retire. The happy couple will soon depart to raise a family and run a store in another town. However, word arrives that Frank Miller, a vicious outlaw whom Kane sent to prison, has been released and will arrive by the noon train, one day ahead of the new marshal. Miller's gang—his younger brother Ben, Jack Colby, and Jim Pierce—wait at the station. For Amy, a devout Quaker and pacifist , the solution is simple—leave town before Miller arrives—but Kane's sense of duty and honor make him stay. Besides, he says, Miller and his gang would hunt him down anyway. Amy gives Kane an ultimatum: she is leaving on the noon train, with or without him. Kane visits old friends and allies, but none can or will help. Judge Percy Mettrick, who sentenced Miller, flees and urges Kane to do the same. Harvey Pell, Kane's young deputy, is bitter that Kane did not recommend him as his successor; he says he will stand with Kane only if Kane \"puts the word in\" for him with the city fathers. When Kane refuses, Pell turns in his badge and pistol. Kane's efforts to round up a posse at Ramírez's Saloon and the church are met with fear and hostility. Some townspeople, worried that a gunfight would damage the town's reputation, urge Kane to avoid the confrontation. Some are Miller's friends, but others resent that Kane cleaned up the town in the first place. Others believe that Kane's fight is not the town's responsibility. Sam Fuller hides in his house, forcing his wife Mildred to tell Kane he is not home. Jimmy offers to help, but he is blind in one eye, sweating, and unsteady. The pastor of the local church, his service interrupted by Kane seeking help from the parishioners, is of no aid. Neither are some apparently willing volunteers, after the mayor encourages Kane to leave town. Martin Howe, Kane's predecessor, is too old and arthritic. Herb Baker agrees to be deputized, but backs out when he realizes he is the only volunteer. One last offer of help comes from 14-year-old Johnny. Kane admires his courage, but refuses his aid. While waiting at the hotel for the train, Amy confronts Helen Ramírez, who was once Miller's lover, then Kane's, then Pell's. Amy believes the reason Kane refuses to leave town is because he wants to protect Helen, but Helen reveals there is no lingering attachment on Kane's part and she, too, is leaving. When Helen questions why Amy will not stay with Kane, Amy explains that both her brother and father were gunned down by criminals, a tragedy that converted her to Quakerism. Helen nonetheless chides Amy for not standing by her husband in his hour of need, saying that if she were in Amy's place, she would take up a gun and fight alongside Kane. Pell saddles a horse and tries to persuade Kane to take it. They end up in a fist fight. After knocking Pell senseless, Kane returns to his office to write out his will. As the clock ticks toward noon, Kane goes into the street to face Miller and his gang. Amy and Helen ride by on a wagon, bound for the train. The train arrives, and Miller steps off as the two ladies board. Kane walks down the deserted main street alone. He manages to kill Frank Miller's brother, Ben, in the opening salvo. Just before the train departs, Amy hears the gunfire and runs back to town. Kane takes refuge in a stable, and Colby is killed when he comes in after him. Miller sets fire to the stable to flush him out. Kane frees the horses and tries to escape on one, only to be shot off and cornered. Despite her religious beliefs, Amy picks up Pell's pistol and shoots Pierce from behind, leaving only Frank Miller, who grabs Amy as a human shield to force Kane into the open. When Amy claws Miller's face, he pushes her to the ground and Kane shoots him dead. The couple embrace. As the townspeople emerge, Kane smiles at Johnny, but looks angrily at the rest of the crowd. He drops his marshal's star to the street and departs with Amy.",

    "plot": "To mark the upcoming United States Bicentennial , heavyweight boxing world champion Apollo Creed plans to hold a title bout in Philadelphia . However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand, and that all other potential replacements are either booked up or unable to get into shape in time. Having already invested heavily into the fight, Creed decides to give a local contender a chance to challenge him. Creed selects Rocky Balboa , an Italian-American journeyman southpaw boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a Mafia loan shark , on the basis of his nickname, \"The Italian Stallion\". Rocky fights in a local Philadelphia fight club, and he won his last fight with Spider Rico. He meets with promoter George Jergens, who tells him Creed has selected Rocky to fight him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight, which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as punching bags . Rocky is later approached by Mickey Goldmill, a former bantamweight fighter-turned-trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about further training. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and saw him as a wasted talent, but eventually Rocky accepts the offer. Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino, a shy woman who is working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish pet store . Adrian's brother and Rocky's best friend, Paulie, helps Rocky get a date with his sister and offers to work as a cornerman with him for the fight, an offer Rocky turns down. Paulie becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the meat packing business where Paulie works for sponsorship as part of the upcoming fight, and both of them reconcile. Rocky trains extensively for the championship fight, while Apollo is unconcerned about the match and puts more effort into promotion than training. The night before the match, Rocky visits the Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to go the distance against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone. On New Year's Day , the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as George Washington and then Uncle Sam . Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries: Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut to restore his vision, while Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final bell sounds, both fighters promise each other there will be no rematch. The fight is extremely well received by the sportscasters and the audience. Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down as Paulie distracts security to help her get into the ring. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision , Rocky and Adrian embrace and profess their love for each other, not caring about the outcome of the fight.",

Apart since childhood, Judah and Esther quickly fall in love. Judah's Roman childhood friend, Messala, returns to Jerusalem as commander of the Fortress Antonia . He fully embraces Rome's glory and imperial power while Judah remains devoted to his faith and the Jewish people's freedom. When Messala demands that Judah surrender potential rebels to Roman authorities, Judah refuses and cuts all ties. The procession of Judean governor Valerius Gratus enters the city. As Judah and Tirzah watch from the upper terrace, loose roof tiles fall, spooking the governor's horse and throwing him off. Messala realizes it was accidental but condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. Messala also arrests Simonides. While he and other prisoners are transported, they stop in Nazareth . Denied water, Judah collapses but is revived when a carpenter gives him a drink. After three years in the galleys, Judah is assigned to Roman Consul Quintus Arrius' flagship. Arrius notices Judah's determination and self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer, which Judah refuses. When Macedonian pirates attack the Roman fleet, Arrius orders that Judah be unchained. The ship's hull is rammed, flooding the galley. Judah frees the other rowers and then rescues Arrius, who was thrown overboard. After being rescued, Arrius learns the battle was won. He later petitions Emperor Tiberius to free Judah, and adopts him as his son . In Rome, Judah becomes a champion charioteer. While returning to Judea, Judah meets Balthasar and Arab Sheik Ilderim. Seeing Judah's prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his four horses in a race before the new Judean governor, Pontius Pilate . Judah declines, despite knowing that Messala is competing. Balthasar tells Judah about a prophet he seeks who preaches love and forgiveness and urges Judah to cast off his consuming hate and vengeance. Judah returns to Jerusalem to search for his mother and sister. At his abandoned house, he finds Esther, who never married, living with her debilitated father and also Malluch, a mute former prisoner. Messala tortured Simonides, who has protected Judah's fortune nonetheless. Presenting himself as Quintus Arrius' son, Judah confronts Messala and demands to know Miriam and Tirzah's fates. Messala orders their release from the dungeons. Both are now lepers and secretly expelled to the Valley of the Lepers. Before leaving the city, the women find and beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah. Esther tells Judah they are dead to stop him searching. Seeking revenge, Judah agrees to drive Sheik Ilderim's four horses against Messala in the chariot race.

Dragged behind his horses, he is trampled by another chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah his mother and sister are alive in the Valley of the Lepers. At the leper colony, Judah encounters Esther and Malluch bringing supplies to Miriam and Tirzah. Esther persuades him to conceal himself as his family would wish. She then follows a crowd and Balthasar to hear what is possibly Jesus Christ 's Sermon on the Mount . Judah meets with Pontius Pilate, who fears Judah's victory will stoke rebellion against Roman rule. Judah rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Returning to the leper colony, he reveals himself to Miriam and finds that Tirzah is dying. Judah and Esther take them to see Jesus Christ, but the trial of Jesus has begun.

Despite pleas from Grand Duke Nicholas and Count Sergei Witte , Nicholas refuses to end the Russo-Japanese War or accept demands for a constitutional monarchy , believing that doing either will make him look weak and endanger the Romanov dynasty. As the war drags on, growing public unrest causes workers to march to the Winter Palace , hoping to present Nicholas with a petition demanding political representation. Soldiers open fire on the approaching crowd, killing hundreds . The resulting revolution forces Nicholas to create the Duma . At a birthday party for the Tsar's mother, Alexandra meets Grigori Rasputin , a self-proclaimed holy man, whom she later turns to for spiritual guidance after court physicians diagnose Alexei with haemophilia . As the years go by, the close relationship between the royal family and Rasputin, along with Rasputin's behavior, leads to public mockery of the royal family. Nicholas eventually dismisses Rasputin from the court despite Alexandra's pleas to keep him. The Romanov Tercentenary celebrations take place, and a lavish tour across Imperial Russia follows, but resentment among the impoverished persists. Amidst the national festivities, Russian prime minister Stolypin is assassinated. Nicholas responds by executing the assassins, allowing the police to terrorize the peasants, and closing the Duma. After a fall at the Spała Hunting Lodge, Alexei experiences a severe bleeding attack, and it is believed he will die. Alexandra sends a telegram to Rasputin, who responds with prayer and instructions for the doctors to leave Alexei alone. His recovery is credited to Rasputin's intervention, and he is allowed to return to the imperial household. After the assassination of Franz Ferdinand , Nicholas orders a mobilization of the Imperial Russian Army on the European border aimed at Austria-Hungary during the July Crisis . Germany responds by declaring war. Later, with the war going badly for Russia on the Eastern Front , Alexandra persuades Nicholas to take personal command of the troops; he leaves for the front, relieving the weary but experienced Grand Duke Nicholas . Alexandra is left nominally in charge upon Nicholas' absence but a series of poor decisions leaves her seen to be a German agent under the influence of Rasputin, resulting in growing unpopularity amongst the population at large as conditions get worse. Nicholas receives a visit from the Dowager Empress, but her requests for him to return to St. Petersburg and remove Rasputin go unheeded. Rasputin's later assassination does little to stop Alexandra's misrule, culminating in revolt by workers and soldiers in St. Petersburg. Nicholas finally attempts to return to Tsarskoye Selo but is instead forced to abdicate on his train. The family, along with a small entourage, are exiled by Alexander Kerensky and the provisional government to Siberia after none of Russia's allies agree to grant the former royals sanctuary, fearing that the lingering resentment at their autocratic rule would unleash similar domestic revolts. The provisional government doesn't last however following the seizing of power by the Bolsheviks and the country's descent into civil war . Fearing that the encroaching pro-monarchist \" Whites \" will attempt to restore the Romanovs, the Bolsheviks in Moscow attempt to have the royal family brought back for trial. En route back to the capital, the royals and their escort are intercepted by representatives of the local Ural Soviet, who seize the royals and bring them to Yekaterinburg . Under harsh conditions, they are guarded by Yakov Yurovsky , who later receives orders to have the family killed.

They sometimes clash with the more affluent Indiana University students in their hometown, who refer to them disparagingly as \"cutters,\" referring to the locals' common work in the limestone industry.

However, his mother, Evelyn, is more understanding and prepares Italian dishes for the family, to Ray's annoyance. Dave develops a crush on a university student named Katherine and masquerades as an Italian exchange student to romance her. One evening, he serenades \"Caterina\" outside her sorority house by singing Friedrich von Flotow 's aria M Apparì Tutt' Amor , with Cyril providing guitar accompaniment.

Cyril wants no trouble, but Mike, a former high school football quarterback, insists on tracking down Rod and starting a brawl. The university president (played by real-life President Dr. John W.

    "plot": "Basil is a staid, somewhat buttoned-up, middle-class Greek-British writer raised in the United Kingdom . While at the Athens port of Piraeus waiting to catch a ferry to Crete he meets a middle-aged peasant and musician named Zorba who carries only a santouri in a case, in contrast to Basil's large quantity of luggage, including cases of books. Basil explains to Zorba that he is travelling to a Cretan village where he owns some land with the intention of re-opening a lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer's block . Zorba has already related that he has experience as a miner and inveigles himself a position as Basil's foreman and factotum . When they arrive at the Cretan village they are greeted enthusiastically by the impoverished populace. They lodge initially with an elderly French former cabaret dancer named Madame Hortense in her self-styled \"Hotel Ritz\". Hortense relates her glamorous and exotic past as a courtesan among the competing Mediterranean powers, hinting that she was the lover of an Italian Admiral called Cannavaro (after whom she has named her pet parrot ). Zorba tries to persuade Basil to enter into a relationship with Madame Hortense, but he is reluctant so Zorba, with an eye on the main chance, seizes the opportunity, somewhat cynically exercising his considerable charm on the lonely woman. Zorba admits to Basil that he has a chequered past, having been guilty of rape and murder as a soldier, his excuse being that they were 'only' Bulgarians and Turks. He asserts that now, however, he rejects nationalism and bears no one any grudges. He also shows Basil his battle wounds, 'all in front' (an oblique reference to Alexander the Great ). Over the next few days, Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine, but it collapses and Zorba narrowly avoids injury. Zorba then has an idea to use the forest in the nearby mountains to source lumber to make new pit-props to replace the rotten timbers of the mine. The land is owned by a monastery . Zorba tricks the monks into believing that a miracle has occurred, as part of a ploy to get them to give up the timber. Exultant, when he gets home he breaks spontaneously into a dance, the so-called 'butcher's dance' or sirtaki in a scene which contrasts his exultant egotism with Basil's nervous inhibition. Zorba designs a system by which tree-trunks can be sent down the mountain suspended from a wire. Among the other residents is a young and attractive widowed woman who is resented and hated by the villagers for not remarrying. A young local boy, the son of one of the more important peasants, is madly in love with her, but she has spurned him repeatedly. One rainy afternoon, Basil offers her his umbrella, which she reluctantly takes. Zorba, who increasingly treats his 'Boss' as a pupil or nephew, knowingly suggests that she is attracted to him, but Basil, ever shy, refuses to pursue her. To get supplies to build the zip-wire to bring the timbers down the mountain, Basil gives Zorba some money and sends him to the large port of Chania to buy cable and other supplies. But in Chania Zorba gets drunk, visits a cabaret, and spends money on presents and on drinking champagne with a cabaret dancer/hospitality girl with whom he spends the night. He also has his hair dyed as a symbol of his rediscovered youth and potency. In a letter to Basil, he details his exploits. Angered by Zorba's irresponsibility and the squandering of his money, Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense, who is smitten with Zorba but feels abandoned, that Zorba intends to marry her upon his return, upon hearing which she is ecstatic. Meanwhile, the Widow returns Basil's umbrella by way of Mimithos, the village idiot . Basil, after much agonising, and untypically unshaven and perhaps drunk, goes to the Widow's house. She lets him in but then she sheds some tears. Embarrassed, he decides to leave but she stops him and they spend the night together. However, their assignation has been observed by the jealous men of the village. When Zorba eventually returns with the supplies and gifts he is surprised and angered to hear of Basil's lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil about his whereabouts the night before. The brief encounter comes at a great cost. Word spreads of Basil's visit to the Widow and the men of the village, to make trouble, tell the youth who is in love with her, whereupon he drowns himself. When the widow attempts to attend the funeral , she is blocked from entering the church by the youth's father. The villagers blame her for the boy's suicide , and some of the men of the village corral her outside the church and begin to stone her, watched and encouraged by the villagers. Basil, unable to push through the crowd to intervene, sends Mimithos to fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as the villager who had maliciously informed the boy of Basil's tryst is about to kill the widow with his knife - with the explicit approval of the boy's father who is watching on. Zorba overpowers the younger man and disarms him but, thinking that the situation is under control, when he asks the widow to follow him and turns to go, the dead boy's father pulls his knife and cuts the widow's throat himself. The villagers close ranks around the father and his accomplices, shielding them as they all disperse, leaving only the outsiders, Basil, Zorba, and the idiot Mimithos, who is distraught. Basil laments his inability to intervene, and Zorba angrily laments the meaninglessness of the widow's death and of all deaths. The film cuts to a scene in which Basil, Zorba and the villagers construct the zip-wire system for the timber, to the accompaniment of light-hearted music on the soundtrack. On a rainy day, Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he had ordered a white satin wedding dress, lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense presents two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to stall, but eventually agrees with gusto, to Basil's surprise. Some time later, Madame Hortense contracts pneumonia and is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side, along with Basil. Meanwhile, word spreads that \"the foreigner\" is dying, and since she has no heirs, the State will take her possessions and money. The poor villagers crowd around her hotel, impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. As two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her, other women try to enter, but Zorba manages to fight them off. At the instant of her death, the women re-enter Madame Hortense's bedroom en masse to steal her valued possessions. Zorba leaves with a sigh, as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense's bedroom, the room is barren apart from her bed (where she lies) and the parrot in her cage. Zorba takes the birdcage with him. Finally, Zorba's elaborate contraption to transport timber down the hill is complete. A festive ceremony is held, including lamb roasting on a spit and a barrel of wine, and all the villagers attend. After a blessing from the priests, Zorba signals by firing a rifle in the air and log is sent hurtling down the zip line but at excessive speed, destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba pretends to be unconcerned and gives orders for a second log to be sent down. This one also comes down too quickly and overshoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and signals for the third log, which accelerates with such violence that it destroys the entire contraption creating havoc among the crowd. The villagers and monks flee in terror, leaving only Basil and Zorba amidst the wreckage. They sit by the shore to eat the roasted lamb and drink the wine alone. Zorba pretends to tell the future from a lamb bone, saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He asks Basil when he plans to leave, and Basil replies that he will go in a few days. Zorba tells him that the one thing Basil is missing is the element of 'madness' that enables a man to 'break free' (the implication being, free from circumstance, responsibility, care). They begin to laugh hysterically at the catastrophic outcome of their scheme and the effect on the villagers. Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance, and the film ends with both men enthusiastically dancing the sirtaki on the deserted shore.",

Briony reads the letter before giving it to her sister. Later, she describes the note to her 15-year-old cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \"sex maniac\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony and Cecilia's older brother Leon, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears attracted to Lola. Before dinner, Robbie and Cecilia are alone in the library, and he apologises for the obscene letter, but she confesses her love for him. They make love against the wall in the library as Briony walks in, sees them, and mistakenly thinks her sister is being raped. During dinner, Lola's twin brothers go missing, and the household organises search parties. While participating in the search, Briony comes across Lola being raped by a man who flees. Despite never seeing the man clearly, Briony is convinced that it was Robbie; a confused Lola who did not see his face does not dissent. Later, Robbie, who has found the twins unharmed, returns with them to the house.  He is arrested for the rape despite Cecilia's pleas of his innocence. Lola and Briony's testimony, along with her turning over the explicit letter, convinces everyone but Cecilia of his guilt. Four years later, during the Second World War , Robbie is released from prison on the condition that he joins the army and fights in the Battle of France . Separated from his unit, he makes his way on foot to Dunkirk . He thinks back to six months earlier when he met Cecilia, now a nurse. Briony, now 18, joined Cecilia's old nursing unit at St Thomas' Hospital in London rather than go to the University of Cambridge . She writes to her sister, but Cecilia cannot forgive her for her part in Robbie's arrest and conviction. Robbie, who is gravely ill from an infected wound and hallucinating, arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he awaits evacuation . Later, Briony, who regrets implicating Robbie, learns that Paul Marshall is about to marry Lola. As Briony attends the wedding, it sinks in that Paul assaulted Lola during the search for the twins years ago. Briony visits Cecilia to ask forgiveness and suggests correcting her testimony, to which Cecilia says she would be an \"unreliable witness\". Briony is surprised to find Robbie living with her sister while in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has not accepted responsibility for her actions. Cecilia calms him down, and Robbie instructs Briony how to set the record straight and get his conviction overturned. Briony agrees. Cecilia adds that Briony should include what she remembers of Danny Hardman, but Briony points out that Paul Marshall was the rapist and Cecilia adds he has just married Lola and now Lola will not be able to testify against her husband. Decades later, when Briony is an elderly and successful novelist, she gives an interview about her latest and last book, an autobiographical novel titled Atonement , and explains that she is dying from vascular dementia . The audience learns that the portion of the book where Robbie and Cecilia are living together and Briony attempts to apologise to them is fictitious. The reality is that she could never atone for her mistake, and Cecilia and Robbie never reunited; Robbie died of septicaemia from his infected wound at Dunkirk, and Cecilia drowned months later during an underground flood due to the Balham tube station bombing during the Blitz . Briony admits that she wrote her novel with its fictitious ending to give the two, in fiction, the happiness they never had because she was responsible for mistakenly identifying Robbie as Lola's rapist. The last scene shows an imagined Cecilia and Robbie happily staying together in the house by the sea which they had intended to visit once they were reunited.",

A new British arrival in the city, Brian Roberts, moves into the boarding house where Sally lives. A reserved academic and writer, Brian must give English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries to seduce Brian, but he tells her that on three previous occasions he has tried to have sexual relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's bohemian life in the last days of the Weimar Republic . When Brian consoles Sally after her father cancels his meeting with her, they become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were \"the wrong three girls\". Maximilian von Heune, a rich, married playboy and baron, befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After a somewhat enigmatic experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in haste. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 marks and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute earns. Sally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge . At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Klub. Meanwhile, Fritz Wendel, a German Jew passing as a Protestant Christian , is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Through Brian, Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents' consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his Jewish background, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi . The rise of Fascism in Europe is an ever-present undercurrent and is the overarching plot of the film. The progress of the primary characters can be tracked through their changing actions and attitudes towards the ever rising tide of German Nazism in the Weimar Republic . In the beginning of the film, a member of the Nazi Party is expelled from the Kit Kat Klub by the club manager, who suffers a subsequent beating. The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s is also demonstrated towards the end of the film in a rural beer garden scene. There a blond boy sings to an audience of all ages (\" Tomorrow Belongs to Me \") about the beauties of nature and youth. It is eventually revealed that the boy is wearing a Hitlerjugend uniform . The ballad then transforms into a militant Nazi anthem , and by the song's end, one by one nearly all of the adults and young people rise and join in the singing. \"Do you still think you can control them?\" Brian then asks Max. After the beer garden scene, Brian gets into a confrontation with a Nazi on a Berlin street, which leads to his receiving a beating. In the final scene of the film in the Kit Kat Klub, it slowly becomes apparent in the hazy club that audience members wearing NSDAP uniforms are now sitting in the preferred front seats of the club.",

At a board meeting, everyone is angry about the fact that more boats are disappearing from the harbor. During the yelling, Frank announces that he is going to start his own company to get around the new restrictions and intends to sell his fish on his own, inviting other local fishermen to join him. The family struggles to get the new business off the ground, relying on Ruby to spread the word. Mr. V encourages Ruby to audition for Berklee College of Music , his alma mater , and offers her private lessons to prepare. Ruby agrees, but her increasing commitments to the family business (her parents are dependent upon her to interpret for them) cause her to be late to their lessons.

The three have enlisted for the Vietnam War . Steven is marrying Angela Ludhjduravic, who was secretly impregnated by another man. The withdrawn Mike and amiable Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, though she appears closer to Nick; he allows her to stay in their house while they are away to escape her abusive alcoholic father. After catching the bouquet at Steven and Angela's wedding, Linda accepts Nick's spontaneous marriage proposal. The three also meet a traumatized Green Beret , who dismisses them. Nick implores Mike to promise that he return from Vietnam. Mike, Nick and their friends go on a final hunting trip where Mike kills a deer with \"one shot\", a feat Nick described as impossible. In Vietnam, Mike, now a Green Beret himself, coincidentally crosses paths with Nick and Steven, who land in a village during an air assault mission. The three are soon imprisoned by the Viet Cong in a cage along a river and forced to participate in games of Russian roulette while the jailers wager. Steven fires his round into the ceiling and is forced into a cage with rats and previous victims of the jailers. To escape, Mike convinces their captors to increase the stakes by loading three bullets into the revolver rather than the standard one. When the next two chambers luckily fall on empty, Mike and Nick turn the gun on their captors, killing two and overpowering the others. Although Nick is wounded in the leg, they rescue Steven and escape. The trio floats down the river on a felled tree trunk, but Nick and Steven are weak from their wounds. They are found by an American helicopter . Nick boards and is rescued, but Steven falls back into the river while trying to hold onto the helicopter skids, and Mike drops down to help him. Steven breaks both of his legs on the river’s rock bottom, so Mike carries him until they join refugees and a South Vietnamese Army convoy. All three of them end up in Saigon . Nick is treated at a U.S. military hospital . When released, now suffering from PTSD , Nick wanders into a gambling den where people are playing Russian roulette.

On a hunting trip with his friends, Mike stops himself from shooting a deer and returns to the cabin, finding Stan cavalierly threatening Axel with a pistol. Mike takes it, inserts a single round, and triggers an empty chamber at Stan's head. Mike repeatedly stays at a hotel instead of his home. Linda follows him each time, and they eventually consummate their relationship. The next day he visits Steven at a veterans' hospital, finding that both of his legs and one arm have been amputated, and he is subsequently refusing to come home. He shows Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of cash from Saigon. Mike realizes that Nick is the source of these payments as well as the father of Angela’s son, and convinces Steven to return to Angela. Mike returns to Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before its fall , to find Nick. He finds Julien and persuades him to take him to another gambling den. There he locates Nick, who has become a professional in Russian roulette and fails to recognize Mike due to drug addiction. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason, but Nick maintains unspirited apathy, even spitting in Mike's face.

    "plot": "In 1957, Pittsburgh , Troy Maxson lives in a modest house with his wife, Rose, and their teenage son, Cory. He works as a garbage collector alongside his best friend, Jim Bono, whom he has known for decades. Troy left home at 14 after standing up to his abusive father, becoming a robber to survive on his own. While serving time for killing a man during a robbery, he met Bono and showed himself to be a talented baseball player. He played well in the Negro leagues , but never made it to the major leagues because the color barrier was not broken until he was past his prime. A gifted storyteller, Troy claims to have survived near-fatal pneumonia as a young man by defeating Death in a wrestling match. Troy's younger brother, Gabriel, sustained a head injury in World War II that left him mentally impaired, and Troy used the $3,000 government payout that Gabe received as the down payment for his house. As Gabriel recently moved out to rent a room elsewhere, Troy no longer gets rent money from Gabriel and is under increased financial strain. Gabriel sometimes gets in trouble with the law for his erratic behavior, so Rose suggests to Troy that Gabriel might be better off residing in a psychiatric hospital . Lyons, Troy's son from a previous relationship, visits Troy on payday to borrow money, which upsets Troy, as he believes a man has a responsibility to work hard to find his own way and provide for his family. Rose tells Troy that Cory is being scouted by a college football team, but Troy refuses to sign the paperwork, saying he does not want Cory to pursue a career in athletics, only to be held back due to discrimination, like he did. The father and son have a distant relationship, seemingly doing little together other than building a fence around the backyard for Rose on Saturdays. When he discovers Cory has switched from a weekday-evening to a weekend shift at the A&P because of football practice, Troy demands that he switch back. He later finds out that Cory did not return to the job, so he tells the football coach that Cory is no longer allowed to play. Cory lashes out, throwing his helmet at Troy, and Troy warns his son that this is \"strike one\". After complaining about his company's racist employment practices, Troy is promoted to a garbage truck driver, becoming the first African-American to do so in Pittsburgh. Bono suspects that Troy is cheating on Rose with Alberta, a woman he met at Taylor's bar, and encourages him to break it off. Troy repeatedly denies the affair, only admitting it to Bono and then Rose after he has gotten Alberta pregnant. He and Rose argue, and, when he aggressively grabs Rose's arm, Cory pushes him away, giving him \"strike two\". Troy and Rose continue to live in the same house, but are estranged. Gabriel is sent to live in a hospital. Alberta dies during childbirth, greatly upsetting Troy, who yells to Death that their fight is just between the two of them. He brings the baby, Raynell, home, and Rose agrees to raise the girl as her own, but refuses to accept Troy back into her life. Cory is considering enlisting in the Marines , having missed his opportunity to attend college. One day, when he returns home, an intoxicated and bitter Troy blocks his path and instigates a fight. When Cory swings a baseball bat at Troy, Troy overpowers Cory and kicks him out of the house. Disoriented, Troy once again challenges Death to come for him. Six years later, Troy dies of a heart attack. Cory, now a corporal in the Marines, returns home, but informs Rose that he has decided not to go to the funeral. Rose is upset and says that, while Troy had many flaws, he tried to do the best he could as a father. Cory reconsiders after sharing memories of Troy with Raynell, who he has not seen since she was a baby. Lyons is serving time in prison for forgery, but gets a furlough to attend the funeral, and Gabriel is released from the hospital as well. Before departing for the cemetery, Gabriel says it is time to tell Saint Peter to open the gates of Heaven for Troy. In the backyard, he attempts to play his trumpet, failing at first, but succeeding on his third try. The Sun comes out from behind the clouds and shines on Troy's family.",

A panorama of London in 1600 is shown and then the viewpoint travels to the Globe Theatre where the audience is being seated. The Chorus enters and implores the audience to use their imagination to visualise the setting of the play. Then is seen, up on a balcony, two clergymen, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely, discussing the current affairs of state. Henry then enters, and discusses with his nobles the state of France. A gift is delivered to Henry from the French Dauphin . The gift turns out to be tennis balls, a jibe at Henry's youth and inexperience. Offended, Henry sends the French ambassador away, and prepares to claim the French throne, a throne that he believes is rightfully his. Then characters from Shakespeare's Henry IV plays, Corporal Nym , Bardolph , and Pistol, are shown. These characters resolve to join Henry's army; however, before they do, Falstaff, another returning character, and one of the King's former mentors, dies. At this point, the action moves to Southampton and out of the Globe. At Southampton, the fleet embarks, and lands in France, beginning a campaign that tears through France to Harfleur , to which Henry's forces lay siege. At the siege, Henry delivers his first rousing speech to his troops: \"Once more... unto the breach! Dear friends, once more!\" The troops charge on Harfleur, and take it as their own. The troops then march to Agincourt , meeting the French forces. The night before the impending battle, Henry wanders around the camp in disguise, to find out what the men think of him. The next day, before the battle, Henry delivers his famous Saint Crispin's Day speech. The action transitions from the Globe to the fields of the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The English archers let forth a volley of arrows that cuts deeply into the French numbers. The French, weighed down by their heavy armour, are caught in the fresh mud of the field, and are bogged down, which gives the English troops ample opportunity to ride out and fight them on equal terms. The French Dauphin, seeing this disadvantage, watches as several bodyguards and noblemen including the Constable of France ride toward the English camp and kill all the boys and squires, prompting a tearful Fluellen to cry that \"this is expressly against the law of arms\". Henry is angered by this and rides out to meet the French Constable, whom he defeats in personal combat. The battle is won. Henry comes to discuss peace and then woos the Princess Katherine . His success means that France is now under the control of England, as the French King, Charles VI , adopts Henry as his successor.

    "plot": "In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that a person's accent determines their prospects in society (\"Why Can't the English?\"). At the Covent Garden fruit-and-vegetable market one evening, he listens to Eliza Doolittle, a young flower seller with a strong Cockney accent, and makes notes. This causes others to suspect he is a detective . Eliza protests that she has done nothing wrong and asks Colonel Pickering, himself a phonetics expert, to confirm this. Pickering and Higgins are delighted to become acquainted; in fact, Pickering had come from India just to meet Higgins. Higgins boasts he could teach even someone like Eliza to speak so well he could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball. Eliza wants to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins's home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees and describes how women ruin lives (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman , learns of his daughter's new residence (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\"). He shows up at Higgins's house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza endures Higgins's demanding teaching methods and harsh treatment (\"Just You Wait\"), while the servants feel both annoyed with the noise as well as pity for Higgins (\"Servants' Chorus\"). She makes no progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \"gets it\" (\"The Rain in Spain\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper-class accent, and is overjoyed at Higgins having danced with her (\"I Could Have Danced All Night\"). As a trial run, Higgins takes her to Ascot Racecourse (\"Ascot Gavotte\"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins is amused. There, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a young upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her (\"On the Street Where You Live\"). Higgins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball, where she dances with a foreign prince. Zoltan Karpathy, a Hungarian former pupil of Higgins, watches, listens, dances with Eliza, and finally declares she is a Hungarian princess. Afterwards, Eliza's hard work is ignored, with all the praise going to Higgins (\"You Did It\"). This and his callous treatment of her, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, but not before she throws his slippers at him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude (\"Just You Wait [Reprise]\"). Outside, Freddy is waiting (\"On the Street Where You Live [Reprise]\") and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk (\"Show Me\"). She tries to return to her old life, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a generous income by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Doolittle feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by \"middle-class morality\" (\"Get Me to the Church On Time\"). Eliza eventually visits Higgins's mother, who is outraged at her son's behavior. The next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her (\"A Hymn to Him\"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. He attempts to talk her into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant (\"Without You\"). He goes home, predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the realization that she has become important to him (\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\"). He turns on his gramophone and listens to her voice. Suddenly, she appears in the doorway. He nonchalantly asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\" She simply smiles.",

Scout, aged six, lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus , a white middle-aged lawyer. Guided by a strong social conscience, Atticus often represents poor farmers who pay him in produce or firewood. Jem and Scout befriend Dill, a boy who visits each summer. The three are both frightened and intrigued by their reclusive neighbour, Arthur \"Boo\" Radley. They fuel each other's imaginations with tales about him and devise ways to lure him outside. After two summers, Scout and Jem begin finding small gifts left in a tree outside the Radley house. Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman and the daughter of Bob Ewell, a violent and racist drunkard. The case inflames racial tensions in the town, and Jem and Scout are taunted at school. On the night before the trial, Atticus positions himself outside the jail where Tom is being held. A lynch mob arrives. The children unexpectedly intervene, and Scout, recognizing the father of a schoolmate, starts a friendly chat. Embarrassed, he persuades the mob to disperse. Jem and Scout sneak into the courtroom to see Tom's trial. With no available seats on the main floor, a local pastor invites them up to the coloured balcony . Mayella states that she invited Tom in to chop up a chifforobe , and that he grabbed her round the throat, beat her and raped her. Witnesses testify that she had bruises on her neck and both arms, and had been heavily 'knocked about' the right side of her head. Atticus points out that the attacker must have been left handed, and that Tom had entirely lost the use of his left arm some years earlier in a farming accident. In spite of witness assertions, there was no medical evidence of any rape, and no doctor was called. Atticus suggests that Mayella was actually beaten by her own (left-handed) father. She denies it, though unconvincingly. Tom testifies that Mayella had invited him in to help with some chores, as she had done many times before. When he noted that the house was unusually quiet, Mayella explained that she had saved up and sent the children off into town to buy ice creams. She then kissed him against his will. Feeling extremely uncomfortable, Tom was attempting to leave when Mayella's father appeared, drunk and enraged. Asked by the prosecution lawyer why he had been doing chores for Mayella without payment, Tom replies that he had  \"felt sorry for her\" – words that offend the white spectators. Atticus urges the all-white jury to put aside prejudice and recognise Tom's innocence. Nonetheless, Tom is found guilty. As Atticus leaves the courtroom, the black spectators in the gallery rise in respect. Atticus hopes for an appeal, but learns from Sheriff Tate that Tom has been shot dead while trying to escape. He breaks the news to Tom's family. Bob Ewell appears and spits in his face. Autumn arrives. While walking home through the woods, Jem and Scout are attacked. Jem suffers a broken arm and is knocked unconscious but, amid the confusion, someone intervenes and Scout sees a strange man carrying Jem home. Atticus calls for a doctor and for Sheriff Tate. As Scout finishes telling the sheriff what happened, her father introduces her to a man shyly standing behind the door: their rescuer is Boo Radley. Ewell is found dead at the scene. Atticus mistakenly assumes Jem must have stabbed him in self-defense, but Sheriff Tate knows that Boo acted to protect the children. Realizing, however, that no purpose would be served by prosecuting Boo, he insists that Ewell must have fallen on his own knife. Scout walks Boo home, taking a moment to stand on the Radley porch to imagine life from his perspective. An adult Scout narrates, recalling that eventful summer and how Atticus had sat all night by Jem's bed, ready to be there for him when he awoke.",

The narration switches to Karen Richards, wife of playwright Lloyd Richards. She recalls the previous October, when she introduced Eve to aging Broadway star Margo Channing, who was starring in a play written by Lloyd. Eve tells Karen, Lloyd, and Margo's maid Birdie that she followed Margo's last theatrical tour to New York City after seeing her perform in San Francisco . She tells of her impoverished childhood and losing her husband in the South Pacific during World War II , and, moved by Eve's story, Margo takes her into her home as her assistant. Eve quickly manipulates her way into Margo's life as both secretary and adoring fan. Margo is also concerned about her romantic relationship with Bill Sampson, eight years her junior, who is directing a film in California. Without telling Margo, Eve arranges a midnight long-distance phone call from Margo to Bill on his birthday. Eve hopes the unexpected late call will show Bill that Margo forgot his birthday and also sends her own greeting. Margo realizes that Eve set her up and asks producer Max Fabian to hire Eve at his office to get her away from Bill; instead, Eve has Karen convince Fabian to make Eve Margo's understudy without Margo's knowledge. As Margo's irritation grows, Karen sympathizes with Eve, believing that Margo is overdramatizing her resentment towards her. Hoping to humble Margo, Karen conspires for her to miss a performance so Eve can perform in her place. Eve secretly invites the city's theater critics, including Addison, to attend the performance. Eve's performance is a triumph. Later that night, Eve attempts to seduce Bill, but he rejects her. Addison interviews Eve for a column, which harshly criticizes Margo for resisting younger talent. Eve apologizes to Lloyd for the things said in the article, and subtly convinces him to consider her instead of Margo for the lead role, Cora, in his next play. Margo and Bill announce their engagement while dining out with Lloyd and Karen. Eve, who had been dining at the same restaurant with Addison, summons Karen to the ladies' room. After first appearing regretful, she delivers an ultimatum: Karen must recommend her to Lloyd to play Cora or she will have Addison expose Karen's part in Margo's missed performance in his newspaper column. When Karen returns to the table—to her relief—Margo surprisingly announces that she does not wish to play Cora. Margo admits that she is too old for the ingénue role, and her impending marriage means that the theater no longer has to be her entire life. Eve is cast as Cora, despite the objections of Bill, who is directing the play. Just before the out-of-town opening , Eve tells Addison that she had seduced and plans to marry Lloyd so that he can write plays for her to star in. Angered by Eve's audacity, Addison reveals he knows her backstory is false; her real name is Gertrude Slescynski, she never went to San Francisco, she was never married, and she was paid to leave town over an affair with her married boss. He blackmails Eve, forbidding her from trying to marry Lloyd and saying she now \"belongs\" to him. The story catches up to the opening scene; months later, Eve is a Broadway star headed for Hollywood. While accepting the Sarah Siddons Award, Eve thanks Margo, Bill, Lloyd, and Karen, who react with indifference. Eve skips the after-party and returns home, where she encounters Phoebe, who claims to be a teenage fan who slipped into her apartment and fell asleep. Eve is angry but softens after Phoebe professes her adoration and ingratiates herself. Eve is considering inviting her to stay over rather than take the long subway ride back home when the doorbell buzzes.

Woolf both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa and her children. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station where she is awaiting a train to central London when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also, but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where, as much as any other person. In 1941, Virginia commits suicide by drowning in the River Ouse . In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown is pregnant with her second child and spends her days in her tract home with her young son, Richie. She married her husband, Dan, soon after World War II and on the surface they are living the American Dream , but she is deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her fear and boldly kisses her on the lips. Kitty accepts the kiss without comment, and both women ignore any hidden meaning it might have. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake. She then takes him to stay with her friend Mrs. Latch. He is terrified of being left without her, although she insists she will be back. She checks into a hotel where she intends to commit suicide. She removes several bottles of pills and Woolf's novel from her purse, and begins to read Mrs. Dalloway . She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooding, awakening with a change of heart. She picks up Richie and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her friend Richard, a poet and author living with AIDS who is about to receive an career achievement award. Clarissa, who Richard frequently refers to as Mrs. Dalloway, is concerned about his depression. Although Clarissa herself is a lesbian who has been living with partner Sally Lester for 10 years, she and Richard were lovers during their college days. He has spent the better part of his life in gay relationships, including one with Louis Waters, who left him several years prior, but who returns for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare for the evening's event. Eventually Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive solely for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn't get it until he was on the brink of death. Having taken several pills, he tells Clarissa, shortly before jumping to his death from a window, she is the best thing he ever had. Later that night, Laura, who is revealed to be Richard's mother, arrives at Clarissa's apartment.

    "name": "The Wolf of Wall Street",
    "plot": "In 1987, twenty-five-year-old Jordan Belfort lands a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild , employed under Mark Hanna. He is quickly enticed by the drug-fueled stockbroker culture and Hanna's belief that a broker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan loses his job following Black Monday , the largest one- day stock market drop in history after the Wall Street crash of 1929 , and takes a job at Investor's Center, a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in pink sheet penny stocks . He makes a small fortune thanks to his aggressive pitching style and high commissions. Jordan befriends his neighbor Donnie Azoff , and the two start their own boiler room-styled brokerage company. They recruit Jordan's childhood friends Robbie Feinberg, Alden Kupferburg, Nicky Koskoff, Chester Ming, and Toby Welch, as well as local drug pusher Brad Bonick, all of whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell,\" and set up the company in an abandoned auto repair shop. Jordan's tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, in which misleading, positive statements inflate a stock's price so it can be sold at an artificially high price. When the scheme's perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price plummets, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than they paid for it. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont in 1989. Soon after, the company becomes immensely successful, moving out of the auto repair shop into a bigger office. An exposé in Forbes which dubs Jordan \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" – \"a sort of twisted Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers\"— initially enrages Belfort until it causes hundreds of ambitious young financiers to flock to the company, thus causing them to move into even bigger offices. As all this is happening, Jordan becomes immensely successful, and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with lingerie designer Naomi Lapaglia; when his wife Teresa finds out about this, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi in 1991. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. In 1993, Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours after securing the IPO of Steve Madden, Ltd. , founded by Donnie's childhood friend and women's shoes designer Steve Madden , bringing him and his firm further FBI attention. Jordan tries to bribe agent Denham but fails, prompting him to seek a safe place for the money. He opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's aunt Emma, a British citizen who is outside the immediate reach of American authorities. He uses Brad's Swiss-Slovenian wife Chantalle and her family, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland . Donnie and Brad get into a heated argument in public during a money exchange, resulting in Brad's arrest as Donnie escapes. Donnie informs Jordan that he has come upon some lemmon 714 quaaludes , which the latter refers to as \"the holy grail\" of drugs. The two take the pills at Belfort’s home, but they have no effect. They assume that they have expired, and wind up taking the rest of their supply. Jordan's private investigator Bo Dietl calls him and tells him he needs to talk to him on a payphone. Jordan drives to a local country club and calls Bo, who informs him that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. While talking with Bo, the quaaludes kick in, and Jordan becomes extremely inebriated, struggling to get home in his Lamborghini Countach . When he gets home, he finds Donnie talking on the phone, and nearly strangles him with the phone cord. Donnie chokes on some meat; Jordan ingests a large amount of cocaine and gives him the Heimlich maneuver . The next day, the police arrive and inform Jordan that his car has been trashed. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father Max advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. In the midst of his farewell speech, Jordan cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying, to the immense support of his friends and employees, but to the anger of his father. In 1996, Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy , when they learn that Emma has died of a heart attack. Fearing for the money he left under her name in his Swiss account, Jordan announces that they will chart a course to Switzerland to forge her name on a document and save the account before going to London for the funeral. To bypass the border patrols, he orders his yacht captain Ted to sail to Monaco , but their ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God to address his worsening drug addiction and attempts to sober up. In 1998, Saurel and Koskoff are arrested for an unrelated crime, the former informing the FBI about Jordan as part of a plea bargain. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence from the rest of his colleagues in exchange for leniency. After having sex for the last time, Naomi tells Jordan that she is divorcing him, and wants full custody of their daughter and infant son. In a cocaine-fueled rage, Jordan punches Naomi and tries to drive away with their daughter, but crashes his car in the driveway. Later, Jordan wears a wire to work and slips a note to Donnie, warning his partner. However, the note is shortly found by the FBI, who arrest Jordan, before they raid and shut down Stratton Oakmont. Despite breaching his deal, Jordan receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security prison for his testimony, and is released in 2000 after serving 22 months. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales techniques, using the same test he used with his founding partners at his firm.",

After an especially hard day in Rome, her doctor gives her an injection and advises: \"Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for awhile.\" She secretly leaves the embassy to explore the city and, as the drug takes effect, falls asleep atop a low wall, where Joe Bradley, an American reporter, finds her. Not recognizing her, he thinks she is intoxicated and takes her to his apartment to sleep it off. Joe oversleeps and misses the princess's scheduled press conference, but claims to his editor, Hennessy, that he attended. Hennessy shows him a news item about the cancellation of the press conference due to the princess's \"sudden illness\". Joe realizes the woman in his apartment is the princess from the newspaper photograph, and asks Hennessy what he would pay for an exclusive interview with her. Hennessy offers $5000, and counters with a $500 bet that Joe will not be able to get it. Joe calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, and offers to show \"Anya\" around Rome, without revealing that he is a reporter and that he knows her true identity. Ann cites an important appointment and leaves. Joe follows and sees her explore an outdoor market, buy shoes, and get her long hair cut short. Joe contrives to meet her on the Spanish Steps and convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street café to meet up with Irving, who takes pictures with a camera concealed in his cigarette lighter. Ann claims to be playing truant from school. When Ann clumsily drives a Vespa through Roman traffic with Joe as a passenger, they are arrested, but Joe and Irving show their \"fake\" press passes and are released. They tour the Colosseum . Joe then takes Ann to the Mouth of Truth and tells her the legend attached to it: if a liar puts their hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off. After Ann tries it after hesitating, it is Joe's turn, and he startles her by pretending that his hand has been cut off. As they attend a dance on a boat that her barber had invited her to, agents from Ann's government try to forcibly take her back. Ann joins Joe, Irving, and the barber to fight them, and smashes a guitar over one of the pursuers heads. When Joe is knocked into the river, Ann jumps in after him. They swim away and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. While drying their wet clothes at Joe's apartment, a radio bulletin says that the people of Ann's country are concerned that her illness may be serious. Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids him a tearful farewell. Upon her return, the princess replies to those attempting to remind her of her duty, \"Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come home tonight...or indeed ever again.\" Joe tells a disbelieving Hennessy that he did not get the story, but tells Irving he cannot stop him from selling the photographs. Joe and Irving attend the rescheduled press conference, to Ann's surprise. She asserts her faith in relations between nations just as between people, and Joe assures her that her faith is not misplaced. When asked which city she most enjoyed visiting, she begins to say it would be difficult before declaring \"Rome. By all means, Rome.\" Other photographers take pictures with their large press cameras, while Irving makes a show of using his cigarette lighter.

The ladies are disappointed to find that the British community is very much separated from the Indian population and culture with a growing Indian independence movement in the 1920s. They are encouraged when the local school superintendent , Richard Fielding, introduces them to the eccentric elderly Hindu Brahmin scholar Professor Narayan Godbole. Mrs. Moore meets by chance another Indian local, Dr Aziz Ahmed, a widower who is surprised by her kindness and lack of prejudice. Aziz offers to host an excursion to the local Marabar Caves . The initial exploration of the caves shows that the size of the party should be limited when Mrs. Moore suffers from claustrophobia and the noise from the large entourage echoes exponentially inside the caves. Mrs. Moore encourages Adela and Aziz to continue their exploration of the caves alone with one guide. They reach the caves at a higher elevation some distance from the group and, before entering, Aziz steps away to smoke a cigarette. Adela enters one of the caves on her own, lights a match, and inexplicably begins to cry. Aziz returns to find Adela has disappeared. Shortly afterwards, he sees her running headlong down the hill, disheveled. She is picked up by the doctor's wife, Mrs. Callendar, and taken to the Callendars' home.

During the battle, the Irish mercenaries fighting for Longshanks defected to Wallace's side, however, nobles Mornay and Lochlan withdrew their cavalry, having been bribed by Longshanks, resulting in Wallace's army being overwhelmed. Wallace also discovers Robert the Bruce had joined Longshanks. After helping Wallace escape, Robert vows to not be on the wrong side again. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal and foils an assassination plot with Isabelle's help. Wallace and Isabelle spend the following night together, while Longshanks' health declines. At a meeting in Edinburgh , Wallace is captured. Realizing his father's role in Wallace's betrayal, Robert disowns his father. In England, Wallace is condemned to execution. After a final meeting with Wallace, Isabelle tells Longshanks, who can no longer speak, that his bloodline will end upon his death as she is pregnant with Wallace's child and will ensure that Longshanks' son spends as short a time as possible as monarch. At his execution, Wallace refuses to submit, even while being tortured and disemboweled . The magistrate encourages Wallace to seek mercy and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", while Longshanks dies. Before being beheaded, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd. In 1314, Robert the Bruce, now Scotland's king, faces the English at Bannockburn , and implores his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. After Wallace's claymore (inscribed with the name \"Braveheart\", hence the film's title) is thrown to land point-down in the ground, Robert leads the Scots to a final victory.",

    "plot": "After being used in a \"guess the weight\" contest at a county fair , orphaned pig Babe is brought home to the farm of the contest winner, Arthur Hoggett. There he is taken in by Border Collie Fly, her irascible mate Rex and their puppies and befriends a duck named Ferdinand, who wakes people by crowing like a rooster every morning so he will be considered useful and be spared from being eaten. Dismayed when the Hoggetts buy an alarm clock, Ferdinand persuades Babe to help him get rid of it. In doing so, they wake Duchess, the Hoggetts' cat, and wreck the house in the ensuing chaos. Rex sternly instructs Babe to stay away from Ferdinand and the house. Seeing Fly saddened when her puppies are put up for sale, Babe lets her adopt him. With the Hoggett's relatives visiting for Christmas , Hoggett decides against choosing Babe for Christmas dinner , and tells his wife Esme that Babe may bring a prize for ham at the next county fair. Ferdinand's love interest Rosanna is served instead, prompting Ferdinand to escape the farm. Babe investigates the fields, where he witnesses a pair of sheep rustlers stealing Hoggett's sheep and quickly alerts Fly and Hoggett, preventing the rustlers from taking the whole flock. Impressed after seeing Babe sort hens, separating the brown from the white ones, Hoggett takes him to try and herd the sheep. Encouraged by an elderly ewe named Maa, Babe gets the sheep to cooperate by asking nicely, but Rex perceives Babe's actions as an insult to sheepdogs. When Fly stands up for Babe, Rex attacks and injures her and bites Hoggett's hand when he tries to intervene.  Rex is subsequently chained to the dog house and sedated, leaving the sheep herding job to Babe. One morning, Babe scares off a trio of feral dogs attacking the sheep, but Maa is mortally injured and dies as a result. Hoggett, thinking Babe was responsible, prepares to shoot him, but Fly finds out the truth from the other sheep and distracts Hoggett long enough for Esme to inform him about the dogs' attacks on neighbouring farms. When Esme leaves on a trip, Hoggett signs Babe up for a local sheep herding competition. As it is raining the night before, Hoggett lets him and Fly into the house, where he is scratched by Duchess, who in turn is temporarily confined outside as punishment. When she is let back in later, she gets revenge on Babe by revealing that humans consume pigs. After learning from Fly that this is true, Babe runs away and Rex finds him the next morning in a cemetery. Hoggett brings a demoralised Babe home, where he refuses to eat. Hoggett feeds him from a baby bottle, sings \" If I Had Words \" and dances a jig for him, restoring Babe's faith in Hoggett's affection. At the competition, Babe meets the sheep that he will be herding, but they ignore his attempts to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticised by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. After promising he will treat them better from now on, the sheep disclose to him a secret password. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd's acclamation, Babe is unanimously given a perfect score. When Babe sits down next to the farmer, Hoggett praises him with the standard command to sheep dogs that their job is done, \"That'll do, Pig. That'll do.\"",

Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big, while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over. Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a young girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. Flo, a dancer in Zanfield's company, sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank.

His superiors place him on temporary leave due to his brashness with students over racial issues, and suggest that he attend a literary seminar in his hometown of Boston . His panel at the seminar is sparsely attended, in contrast to a packed room for an interview with Sintara Golden, whose bestselling novel We's Lives in Da Ghetto panders to Black stereotypes . In Boston, Monk has dinner with his mother Agnes, who has Alzheimer's disease , and his sister Lisa, a physician. While having drinks with Monk, Lisa suffers a fatal heart attack. Their estranged brother Cliff, a plastic surgeon, attends Lisa's funeral. Newly divorced and out of the closet , Cliff engages in frequent drug use and casual sex. Monk meets Coraline, a lawyer living across the street from his mother's beach house, and begins dating her.

After submitting it to publishers out of contempt, he is shocked to be offered a $750,000 advance, which he reluctantly accepts to pay for his mother's care. His agent Arthur convinces him to adopt the persona of \" Stagg R. Leigh \", a convict on the run, to protect his reputation. As \"Stagg\", Monk is offered a movie deal from film producer Wiley. In response to insulting comments by the publishing executives, Monk tries to sabotage the deal by demanding the title be changed to Fuck , but the publishers concede to his ultimatum. Monk is invited to help judge the New England Book Association's Literary Award as part of a \" diversity push \" and he reluctantly accepts.

The panel's white judges rave over Fuck , though Sintara deems the subject matter \"pandering.\" While Monk agrees, he argues that Sintara's book is \"trauma porn\" and inauthentic to her black middle-class background. Sintara counters that she researched her book by interviewing voiceless people and was just giving the market what it wants. On family housekeeper Lorraine's wedding day, Monk finds Cliff living in Agnes's beach house with two other men, but Lorraine is happy to have him attend the wedding. At the reception, Monk and Cliff discuss the impact of their father's suicide, with Cliff encouraging Monk to let people \"love all of him\". At the awards ceremony, Fuck is announced as the winner.

    "plot": "In 1951, police investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, Turing talks of his work at Bletchley Park during WWII . In 1928, the young Turing is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with Christopher Morcom , who sparks his interest in cryptography , he soon develops romantic feelings. However, Christopher shortly dies from tuberculosis. When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander , John Cairncross , Peter Hilton , Keith Furman, and Charles Richards in Bletchley Park , directed by Commander Alastair Denniston . They are to analyze the Enigma machine , which the Nazis use to send coded messages. Difficult to work with, and believing his colleagues to be inferior, Turing works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. When Denniston refuses to fund the machine's £100,000 construction cost, Turing contacts Prime Minister Winston Churchill who appoints him as team leader and provides necessary funds. Turing then fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers as a test to find replacements. Cambridge graduate Joan Clarke passes Turing's test but her family will  not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. Clarke helps Turing warm to the others, who begin to respect him. Turing's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; as the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. When Clarke plans to leave because of her parents, Turing proposes, which she accepts. During their engagement party, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who advises him to keep it a secret. Overhearing a clerk talking about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany: he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages . A German coder always opening his first message with a standard plaintext German script reveals enough of the day's Enigma code for Christopher to quickly decode all the day's messages. Recalibrating the machine, it quickly decodes a message, and the cryptographers celebrate. Discovering a convoy is about to be attacked, Turing realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it the Germans will know Enigma is compromised and change it. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although Peter begs them, as his brother is part of it. Turing creates a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection. Discovering Cairncross is a Soviet spy, Turing confronts him. He argues that the Soviets are allies,  working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals in turn that he already knew, and has been using Cairncross to leak misinformation to the Soviets for British benefit. Turing urges Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, telling her he is a homosexual. She tells him that she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Fearing for her safety, Turing says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills.  Although heartbroken, Clarke stays on, knowing how important it is. She refuses to bow down to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or what they think of her decisions. After the war, Menzies has the cryptographers destroy the evidence, as MI6 wants governments to believe they have unbreakable code machines. The team should never meet again or share what they have done. In 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and undergoes chemical castration instead of prison, so he can continue his work.

    "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-20th century, police investigate a mathematician after an apparent home break-in. During his interrogation, he talks of his work at a secret government facility during a global war. In his youth, the young mathematician is constantly bullied at boarding school. Developing a friendship with a classmate who sparks his interest in cryptography, he soon develops romantic feelings. However, his friend shortly dies from illness. When his country declares war, he joins a cryptography team at a secure government location. They are to analyze an encryption machine used by the enemy to send coded messages. Difficult to work with, and believing his colleagues to be inferior, he works alone to design a machine to decipher these messages. When his superior refuses to fund the machine's construction cost, he contacts a high-ranking government official who appoints him as team leader and provides necessary funds. He then restructures the team and places a difficult crossword in newspapers as a test to find replacements. A brilliant female graduate passes his test but her family will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. He arranges for her to live and work with the women who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. She helps him warm to the others, who begin to respect him. His machine is constructed but cannot determine the encryption settings quickly enough. His superior orders it to be destroyed and him fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if he goes. When the woman plans to leave because of her parents, he proposes, which she accepts. During their engagement party, he confirms his homosexuality to a colleague, who advises him to keep it a secret. Having an epiphany about decoding messages, the machine can now quickly decode all daily messages. Discovering a military convoy is about to be attacked, he realizes that if they suddenly react to prevent it the enemy will know the code is compromised. Therefore, the team cannot act on every decoded message, so they do not act to save the convoy although one member begs them, as his brother is part of it. He creates a statistical model to choose the warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize detection. Discovering a colleague is a foreign spy, he confronts him. After various confrontations and revelations about espionage, he urges the woman to leave, telling her he is homosexual. She tells him that she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Fearing for her safety, he says he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills. Although heartbroken, she stays on, knowing how important it is. After the war, the intelligence agency has the team destroy the evidence. In a later year, he is convicted of a moral crime and undergoes chemical castration. The woman visits him, witnesses his deterioration, and tries to comfort him. He ultimately dies by suicide. Years later, he receives a posthumous pardon. Historians estimate that breaking the enemy's code shortened the war by over 2 years, saving millions of lives, and his work was an important step towards modern computing."

    "plot": "In 1780 in Frankfurt youngster Nathan Rothschild warns his parents Mayer and Guttle that the taxman is coming. They hurriedly hide their wealth. The taxman demands 20,000 gulden , an exorbitant sum, but accepts a bribe of 5,000 in exchange for assessing them 2,000 in taxes. Mayer's satisfaction is short-lived, however; a courier bringing him 10,000 guldens is intercepted and the money confiscated by the taxmen. Mayer tells his sons that he tries to be as honest as possible, but the authorities will not let him; he admonishes his children to acquire money, for \"money is power\" and can protect their people. Later, as Mayer is lying on his deathbed, he instructs his five sons to start banks in different countries across Europe: Amschel in Frankfurt am Main , Salomon in Vienna, Nathan in London, Carl in Naples, and James in Paris. That way, they can avoid having to send gold back and forth when the need arises, for in war they are in danger of being robbed by the enemy and in peace by their own countrymen. Instead, they can draw on each other's banks. Thirty-two years later, the sons have established banking houses. Then France overruns Europe in the Napoleonic Wars . Austrian Prince Metternich asks Salomon to raise 15 million florins to help defeat Napoleon . The other brothers are approached with similar requests. Even in France itself, Talleyrand asks for 50 million francs . Nathan refuses to loan the British Government five million pounds (on top of previous loans) to hold off the enemy, but offers the Duke of Wellington twice that amount to smash him. After the war is won, Wellington is disappointed to find that Nathan Rothschild has not even been invited to a party in the duke's honour. He insists on going to see Nathan. His aide, Captain Fitzroy, knows the address, as he and Nathan's daughter Julie are in love. While there, Wellington tells Nathan that the victorious powers are going to make a very large loan to France to help it recover from the war. The winning underwriter will become the most powerful and prestigious bank in Europe. Nathan's bid is the best, but is rejected primarily in favor of Barings Bank . When Nathan demands to know the reason, Prussian Count Ledrantz (despite having himself sought a war loan from the Rothschilds) explains it was discarded on a \"technicality\", because Nathan is a Jew. Nathan learns that the quarter of the loan not awarded to Barings will fall to Ledrantz, Metternich and Talleyrand, who stand to make enormous profits. Nathan outmanoeuvres them financially, bringing them to the brink of ruin and dishonour; they capitulate and surrender to him the entire loan. However, this has somewhat embittered him. Where once he accepted Julie's choice, he now tells the non-Jewish Fitzroy to stay away from her. Anti-Jewish riots break out all over Germany, instigated by Ledrantz. Nathan returns to Frankfurt and, under pressure from his own people, agrees to submit to Ledrantz. However, before he can, he receives word that Napoleon has escaped from exile . Nathan's brothers, fearful of their positions, want to support the restored French Emperor. However, Nathan refuses to do so. With Ledrantz and others once again desperately in need of financial support, he extracts a treaty from them granting Jews rights, freedoms and dignity long denied them. He also tells Fitzroy that he can once again see Julie. With Napoleon seemingly invincible, Nathan determines to risk all in support of the allies. Just before he is bankrupted, he receives word that Wellington has won the Battle of Waterloo , and he is not only saved, he becomes the richest man in the world and a baron.",

    "plot": "In 1959, the Clutter family murders take place on their Kansas farm. While reading The New York Times , Truman Capote is riveted by the story and calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy. Capote travels to Kansas, inviting childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee to come along. He intends to interview those involved with the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator. Alvin Dewey , the Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead detective on the case, brushes him off. Still, Dewey's wife Marie is a fan of Capote's writing and persuades her husband to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner. Capote's stories of movie sets and film stars captivate Marie. Over time, her husband warms to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims. The Deweys, Lee, and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects, Perry Smith and Richard \"Dick\" Hickock , are caught. Flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote's visits to the prison where the accused are held. Capote begins to form an attachment to Smith. He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book. Following the trial and conviction, after which both Smith and Hickock are sentenced to death, Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch. Capote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the \"first three parts\" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy . The story of Smith's life, his remorseful manner, and his emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal. Still, he is frustrated, as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened the night of the murders. Though initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote's opportunity to speak with the killers, the appeals process drags on for several years. Without the court case being resolved, Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending and is unable to complete his book. Eventually, he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. He has what he wants from Smith, but he sees callousness and selfishness in his own actions in the process. With everything now in hand, Capote still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work. Lee's best-selling novel To Kill a Mockingbird is turned into a movie, but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend's success, too caught up in drinking through his misery. With the last appeal rejected, Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed, but Capote cannot bring himself to do so. A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas. There, he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed. Capote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it. She replies, \"Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to\". While returning home, Capote reviews the writings and drawings given to him by Smith, as well as an early childhood photo of Smith and his sister. An epilogue notes that In Cold Blood made Capote the most famous writer in America; that Capote never finished another book, dying in 1984 from complications due to alcoholism; and that he chose a quote from Saint Teresa of Ávila – \"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones\" [ 3 ] [ 4 ] – as the epigraph for his unfinished final novel .",

An experienced dynamiter, Jordan is ordered to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a critical bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist guerrillas . The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists. Jordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love with one of the guerrillas, a young woman named María. María's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the Falangists (part of the fascist coalition ) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger him and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for María. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the guerrillas' allegiance to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate last stand , Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation. However, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a rout . Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using hand grenades . Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.

While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed.

He suddenly meets Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his troupe of performers who are writing a play called Spectacular Spectacular . After Christian helps them complete the play, they go to the Moulin Rouge where they hope Christian's talents will impress Satine, the star performer and courtesan , who will in turn convince Harold Zidler, the proprietor of the Moulin Rouge, to let Christian write the show. However, Zidler plans to have the wealthy, powerful and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth sleep with Satine in exchange for potential financing to convert the club into a theater. That night, Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and attempts to seduce him by dancing with him before retiring to her chamber with him to discuss things privately, but eventually Christian reveals his true identity. After the Duke interrupts them, Satine claims that the two of them and the Bohemians were rehearsing Spectacular Spectacular . Aided by Zidler, Christian and the Bohemians improvise a story for the Duke about a beautiful Indian courtesan who falls in love with a poor sitar player she mistook for a wealthy but evil maharaja . Approving the story, the Duke agrees to invest, but only if Satine and the Moulin Rouge are turned over to him. Later, Satine claims not to be in love with Christian, but he eventually wears down her resolve and they kiss. During construction at the Moulin Rouge, Christian and Satine's love deepens while the Duke becomes frustrated with all the time he thinks Satine is spending with Christian working on the play. To calm him, Zidler arranges for Satine to spend the night with the Duke and angrily tells her to end her affair with Christian. She misses the dinner when she falls unconscious, leading a doctor to diagnose a fatal case of consumption . She does try to end things by telling Christian that their relationship is endangering the production, but Christian writes a secret song to include in the show that affirms their unending, passionate love. At the final rehearsal, can-can dancer Nini hints to the Duke that the play represents the relationship between him, Christian, and Satine. Enraged, the Duke demands that the show end with the courtesan marrying the maharaja, instead of Christian's ending where she marries the sitar player.

He tells her that her illness is fatal, that the Duke is planning on murdering Christian, and that if she wants Christian to live, she must cut him off completely and be with the Duke. Mustering all her acting abilities, she complies, leaving Christian devastated. On the opening night of the show, in front of a full audience, Christian denounces Satine and vows to give her to the Duke before walking off the stage, but Toulouse-Lautrec cries out from the rafters, \"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.\" This spurs Satine to sing their secret song, causing Christian to change his mind. After Zidler and the company thwart several attempts by the Duke and his bodyguard to kill Christian, the show ends with Christian and Satine proclaiming their love as the Duke permanently storms out of the cabaret.

    "plot": "In 1863, 1st Lieutenant John J. Dunbar—serving with the Union army —is wounded in a stalemated battle at St. David's Field in Tennessee . The surgeon intends to amputate his leg. Choosing death in battle instead, Dunbar steals a horse and rides in front of Confederate lines unarmed, but miraculously survives his suicide attempt. Union troops take advantage of the distraction to mount a successful attack. Dunbar is given medical care that saves his leg and is awarded \"Cisco\", the horse he rode during his suicide attempt, along with his choice of posting. He requests a transfer to the American frontier to see it before it disappears. Dunbar arrives at Fort Hays where its commander, Major Fambrough, assigns him to the furthest outpost under his jurisdiction: Fort Sedgwick . Fambrough, who is mentally ill, kills himself after Dunbar departs. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a foul-mouthed mule-wagon provisioner, and finds the fort deserted. He decides to rebuild the fort, recording his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by a band of Pawnee while returning to Fort Hays. The deaths of Timmons and Fambrough leave the army unaware of Dunbar's assignment, so no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post. Dunbar encounters his Sioux neighbors when they attempt to steal his horse and intimidate him. Wanting to make peace, he seeks out the Sioux camp. En route, he comes across Stands With A Fist, a white ethnic Sioux woman who was adopted as a girl by the tribe's medicine man, Kicking Bird, after Pawnee killed her family. She is mutilating herself in mourning for her late Sioux husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover. Though the Sioux are initially hostile, Dunbar gradually establishes a rapport with them, notably Kicking Bird, the Sioux fighter Wind In His Hair, and the youth Smiles A Lot. Stands With A Fist acts as an interpreter, speaking Lakota and English. Dunbar comes to respect and appreciate the Sioux. He is accepted into their group after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. He also befriends a wolf he dubs \"Two Socks\" for his white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, he is given a name that translates as Dances With Wolves. Dunbar learns the Lakota language , and he and Stands With A Fist grow close. He gives the Sioux firearms to help them defend against the Pawnee attack. He eventually earns Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands With A Fist. Because of the threat of encroaching white settlers, Chief Ten Bears decides to move his group to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them but first attempts to retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgwick, as it would help the U.S. Army locate the group at its new location. When he arrives, he finds the fort reoccupied by the army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco, and capture Dunbar. He cannot prove his story as one of the soldiers had stolen his diary. Refusing to help the army hunt down the Sioux, he is charged with desertion, and the soldiers begin to transport him back east as a prisoner. Two Socks attempts to follow Dunbar but is shot dead by the soldiers. Dunbar's Sioux friends track and attack the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. They meet the others at the winter camp. Dunbar leaves with Stands With A Fist because his presence would endanger the group. As they leave, Dunbar and Kicking Bird exchange parting gifts. Smiles A Lot returns the diary he recovered during Dunbar's rescue, and Wind In His Hair proclaims his everlasting friendship to Dunbar. U.S. troops search the mountains but cannot locate Dunbar or the Sioux. The film's epilogue text states that the last of the free Sioux would surrender at Fort Robinson , Nebraska , 13 years later.",

    "plot": "In the waning days of World War II , the United States Navy cargo ship Reluctant operates in areas of the Pacific Ocean far from enemy action. Lt. (j.g.) Doug Roberts, the executive officer and cargo chief, shields the dispirited crew from their tyrannical captain, Lt Cdr. Morton. Morton takes pride in his status, symbolized by a palm tree on the foredeck, given to him for the ship’s past success in cargo supply. Roberts shares quarters with Ensign Frank Thurlowe Pulver, the laundry and morale officer. Pulver is intimidated by the captain, and avoids him so completely that Morton is initially unaware that Pulver is a crew member. Pulver’s grandiose ideas on pranking the captain never successfully materialize. Eager to join the fighting, Roberts repeatedly requests a transfer, but Morton's refusal to endorse his requests results in them being rejected. Roberts surreptitiously requests and is granted crew liberty from one of Morton's superiors, a port captain who wishes to reward the Reluctant ' s crew for meeting a difficult resupply schedule. When the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, however, Morton cancels the crew's shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that his transfer requests and reports of low crew morale are hurting Morton's chance of promotion and that the crew will be denied leave unless Roberts submits fully to Morton's command style, ceases to request a transfer, and never tells the crew why. Roberts acquiesces, and the crew is granted liberty. The ship is kicked out of port after the crew’s raucous liberty and the angry captain, in reprimanding the crew, prods Roberts to back him. The crew is mystified by Roberts' new strictness and deference to the captain. Morton convinces them that Roberts is vying for a promotion. When a crew member informs Roberts of a new Navy policy which could help him receive a transfer despite the captain's opposition, Roberts declines. News of the Allied victory in Europe depresses Roberts further, as the war may end soon without his ever seeing combat, and Roberts tosses Morton's prized palm tree overboard. Morton eventually realizes Roberts is the likely culprit and summons him to his quarters and accuses him of the deed. An open microphone allows the crew to overhear their heated conversation and why Roberts changed. Weeks later, Roberts receives an unexpected transfer. 'Doc,' the ship's doctor and Roberts' friend, confides to him that the crew risked court-martial by submitting a transfer request with Morton's forged signature of approval. Before he leaves, the crew present Roberts with a handmade medal, the Order of the Palm, for \"action against the enemy\". Several weeks later, Pulver, who has been appointed cargo officer, receives several letters. The first is from Roberts, enthusiastic about his new assignment aboard the destroyer USS Livingston during the Battle of Okinawa . The second letter is from Pulver's college friend, Fornell, also assigned to the Livingston, which reveals that Roberts was killed in a kamikaze attack shortly after the first letter had been posted. No longer afraid, Pulver throws the captain's replacement palm tree overboard, marches into Morton's cabin, and claims responsibility. Morton realizes his problems have not gone away.",

The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss. Their exploits also become more violent. After C.W. botches parking during a bank robbery and delays their escape, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face when he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. Clyde's older brother Buck and his wife, Blanche , a preacher's daughter, also join them. The two women dislike each other at first sight, and their antipathy escalates. Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde, and C.W., while Bonnie sees Blanche's flightiness as a constant danger to the gang's survival.

Patton's command redeems itself at the Battle of El Guettar . Following Allied victory in North Africa , Patton and Montgomery offer competing plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily . Patton suggests British landings at Syracuse due to its historical importance, with US forces landing at Palermo and capturing Messina to prevent Axis withdrawal. General Harold Alexander opts for Montgomery's more cautious plan of landing Patton's 7th US Army at the Gulf of Gela and Montgomery on eastern Sicily. The British and Canadians bog down, and Patton's army, expected only to provide flank support, instead drives northwest to take Palermo. Intent on capturing Messina before the British, he pushes subordinates Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott to make risky amphibious landings heedless of the cost.

He enters Messina as a conquering hero, but receives notice that he must apologize publicly for the slapping incident. Despite apologizing, he is sidelined for the coming Allied invasion of France and instead placed in command of the fictitious First United States Army Group as a decoy in London , the Allied command confident in that keeping Patton in England will tell the Germans that he will lead the invasion of Europe. To a public gathering in the town of Knutsford , Patton remarks that the post-war world will be dominated by the British-American spheres of influence; this comment is viewed as a slight to the Soviet Union .

Georges' goddaughter Isabelle suggests that Hugo confront Georges and demand it back. Georges proposes that Hugo work at his toy store as recompense, and after some time he might return the notebook. Hugo accepts and commences work, in addition to his job maintaining the clocks. Isabelle and Hugo become fast friends, and Hugo is astonished to see she wears a heart-shaped key, given to her by Georges. Hugo shows her the automaton, which they activate with the key. It draws a scene from A Trip to the Moon , once described to Hugo by his father. Isabelle identifies the drawing's signature as that of \" Georges Méliès \" – her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of drawings, but they are discovered by Georges, who bans Hugo from his house. Several days later, at the Film Academy Library, Hugo and Isabelle find a book about the history of cinema that praises Méliès' contributions. They meet the book's author, René Tabard, a film expert who is surprised to hear Méliès is alive, as he disappeared after World War I along with the copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet Méliès again, René agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges' home to show his copy of A Trip to the Moon . Finding the heart-shaped key on the station railway tracks, Hugo drops down to the track to retrieve it, and is run over by an out-of-control train that smashes through the station . He wakes up from the nightmare, but hears an ominous ticking emanating from himself, and discovers he has been turned into the automaton. Hugo wakes up again : it was only another nightmare. At Georges' home, his wife Jeanne allows them in after René recognises her as Jeanne d'Alcy , an actress in many of Méliès' films. They play the film, waking Georges, who is finally convinced to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dreams. Georges recounts that, as a stage magician, he was fascinated by motion pictures and used film to create imaginative works through his Star Film Company . Forced into bankruptcy after the war, he closed his studio and sold or destroyed his films. He laments that even an automaton he built and donated to a museum was lost in a fire; Hugo realizes it is the one he has repaired. Hugo races to the station to retrieve the automaton but is caught by Dasté, who has learned of Claude's death. Dasté threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage to torment him. Hugo runs away and manages to evade Dasté by hiding on the outer face of the clock tower, precariously balancing hundreds of feet above the ground. After climbing back down, Hugo races to escape the station but drops the automaton on the tracks. He jumps down to retrieve it and is almost run over by a train, but Dasté saves him and the automaton. Georges arrives and tells Dasté, \"This child belongs to me.\" Sometime later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by René. Hugo and his new family celebrate at the apartment, and Isabelle begins to write down Hugo's own story.",

That evening, he walks into a traveling carnival and watches a geek show in which a deranged man eats a live chicken. Stan runs into the carnival's strongman and is offered a temporary job for the night. He is subsequently convinced by carnival owner Clem to stay and begins working with \"Madame Zeena\", the carnival's clairvoyant act, and her alcoholic husband Pete. Stan begins courting fellow performer Molly and asks her to leave the carnival with him, but she refuses. Madame Zeena and Pete teach Stan how to use the coded language and cold reading tricks in their act, while warning him against pretending to speak to the dead . Stan also learns that Clem hires troubled alcoholics to be his geeks, then gives them opium -laced alcohol so they stay. One night, Pete asks Stan for alcohol and is found dead the next day. Local law enforcement raid the carnival after learning about the geek show. Stan uses his cold reading skills to placate the local sheriff and manipulate him into showing leniency. Shortly thereafter, Molly agrees to leave the carnival with Stan. Two years later, Stan runs a successful psychic act for the wealthy elite of Buffalo . Molly performs as his assistant, but their relationship has deteriorated as Stan demands perfection from Molly. During a performance, psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter interrupts and tries to expose their act. Stan bests and humiliates Ritter with his cold reading skills, then reads the man sitting with Ritter, Judge Kimball. After the show, Kimball asks Stan to help him and his wife communicate with their dead son. Stan agrees over Molly's objections. Stan meets with Ritter to purchase information on Kimball. Ritter agrees, but requests Stan sit for a psychotherapy session in lieu of payment. That night, Molly invites Madame Zeena and other performers to the hotel for an impromptu party. Madame Zeena warns Stan not to do Kimball's reading, claiming to have read his plans from tarot . Stan performs a successful reading for Kimball and his wife and is paid handsomely. He offers to split the fee with Ritter, but she declines, instead agreeing to hide the money from Molly. Stan informs Ritter that Kimball has offered to introduce him to Ezra Grindle, a very wealthy industrialist and her former patient. At Stan's request, Ritter reluctantly provides incomplete information about Grindle; Stan steals the rest from her records, learning that Grindle forced an abortion on a young woman named Dorrie, and that she likely died from the botched procedure. After successfully convincing Grindle that he is a true medium with the stolen information, Stan starts an affair with Ritter and begins drinking. Stan holds regular sessions with Grindle for exorbitant fees, while Grindle begins to increasingly demand that Stan make Dorrie's spirit materialize. Stan plans to have Molly pose as Dorrie, which she agrees to do only if she can leave Stan afterwards. On the day Stan plans to \"materialize\" Dorrie, Kimball's wife murders her husband and commits suicide to be reunited with their son, inspired by Stan's previous reading for them. That evening, Grindle confesses to Stan that he hurt more women after Dorrie's death. Molly makes her appearance as Dorrie immediately after, but her disguise fails when Grindle hugs her. Infuriated, Grindle strikes Molly, provoking Stan to beat him to death. Horrified by the events of the night, Molly leaves. Stan arrives at Ritter's office to retrieve his savings, but she withholds almost all of it, revealing that she was manipulating him all along. He attacks her but is forced to escape when security arrives. A flashback reveals he killed his bedridden father by intentionally exposing him to hypothermia before burning the house down. Months later, Stan, now homeless and an alcoholic, sees ads for Madame Zeena in a newspaper. Stan finds a new carnival and learns that his old carnival went out of business. He desperately pitches his mentalist act to the new owner, who rejects it based on Stan's appearance and the act being out of fashion. The owner then offers him a drink and temporary work as a geek, using the same pitch Clem described earlier. Recognizing the trap, Stan nevertheless accepts the job, claiming he was born for it before breaking down laughing.",

She and CIA officer Dan Fuller attend the black site interrogations of Ammar , a detainee with suspected links to several of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks and who is subjected to approved enhanced interrogation techniques . Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia , but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti . Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed. In 2009, Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica travels to a US base in Afghanistan to meet a Jordanian doctor, highly placed in al-Qaeda, who has offered to become a US spy for $25 million. Instead, he turns out to be a triple agent loyal to al-Qaeda, and Jessica is killed, along with several other CIA officers, when he detonates a suicide vest in what will come to be known as the Camp Chapman attack , the worst attack on CIA personnel in 25 years. Thomas, an analyst who linked the Abu Ahmed lead, shares with Maya an interrogation of a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier, information that was buried and lost track of in one of the many files of information that had been accumulated at the time—that is—that in 2001, a man named Ibrahim Sayeed traveled under the nom de guerre of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Seeing his picture, realizing that it is similar to but not the man in the picture they had that they thought was of Abu Ahmed, and that her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the CIA headquarters . She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is in fact one of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining the account of Ahmed's supposed death in 2001. A Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother to Dan for a Lamborghini Gallardo Bicolore . Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls tradecraft , thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown. The CIA puts the compound under surveillance but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President Barack Obama , the CIA director holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60–80% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%. On May 2, 2011, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flies two stealth helicopters from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six) and the CIA's Special Activities Division to raid the compound. The SEALs gain entry and kill several people in the compound, including a man whom they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in Jalalabad , Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse.

    "plot": "On the way to a slave auction, Marcellus Gallio, a Roman military tribune and senator 's son, helps recapture Demetrius, a defiant Greek slave. At the auction site, Marcellus is reunited with Diana, his childhood love, who is now a ward of Emperor Tiberius and has been pledged in marriage to the regent Caligula . Marcellus has a longstanding feud with Caligula, and he outbids Caligula for Demetrius, who does not attempt to escape again, as he feels honor-bound to Marcellus. Demetrius becomes Marcellus' personal servant. That evening, Caligula vengefully transfers Marcellus to far-flung Jerusalem . Diana goes to the port to say she will appeal to Tiberius on Marcellus' behalf, and the pair pledge their love and reaffirm their youthful promise to marry one day. Accompanied by Demetrius and the centurion Paulus, Marcellus arrives in Jerusalem on the same day that Jesus , who is being hailed as the Messiah, enters the city . Demetrius feels compelled to follow Jesus and later attempts to warn him of a plot against him , but a distraught man tells Demetrius that Jesus has already been arrested. Pontius Pilate , the governor of Judaea , informs Marcellus that he has been recalled by order of Tiberius, and gives Marcellus his last task, which is to handle the execution of three criminals—one of whom is Jesus. Marcellus wins Jesus' robe from Paulus in a dice game on Calvary , but when he uses it to shield himself from rain, he feels a sudden, intense pain. Grabbing the robe, Demetrius denounces Marcellus and the Roman Empire and frees himself, leaving a mentally unstable Marcellus, who is haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion, to report to Tiberius at Capri alone. The emperor's soothsayer says the robe must be cursed, so Tiberius gives Marcellus an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe, as well as identify the followers of Jesus. At Diana's request, Tiberius leaves her free to marry Marcellus once he has successfully completed his mission. Marcellus eventually makes his way to Cana , whose inhabitants experienced Jesus' miracles and believe he rose from the dead. Learning from Justus, a kind weaver, that Demetrius is in the town, Marcellus confronts his former slave at an inn. Demetrius says the robe has no real power, and it is Marcellus' guilt over killing Jesus that is causing his illness. When Marcellus tries to destroy the robe anyway, he is overcome, and finds himself healed. Pilate having ordered the arrest of all of the Christian \"fanatics\", Paulus sneaks into Cana with his troops. After Justus is killed by a surprise arrow, Marcellus manages to halt the attack, but Paulus informs him that Caligula has succeeded Tiberius as emperor, so Marcellus' commission is no longer valid. Paulus initially refuses Marcellus' order to leave the town, but he complies after Marcellus beats him in a duel. Jesus' apostle Peter invites Marcellus to join Demetrius and him as missionaries, and, after confessing his role in Jesus' death, Marcellus pledges his life to Jesus. When Peter's missionary group comes to Rome, Demetrius is captured and tortured for information. Caligula asks Diana if she has heard from Marcellus, and, as she has not, tells her of Marcellus' involvement with the Christians. The Gallios' slave Marcipor, who is secretly a Christian, shows Diana where Marcellus is hiding, shortly before Marcellus leads a raid to rescue Demetrius. Demetrius is brought to the house of Senator Gallio, where Peter miraculously heals his grievous wounds. Marcellus and Demetrius attempt to flee the city, but horsemen dispatched by Caligula pick up their trail, and Marcellus gives himself up so Demetrius can escape. At his trial, Marcellus admits to being a follower of Jesus, but denies that the Christians are plotting against Rome. He is condemned to death, unless he renews his tribune's oath of loyalty to the emperor and renounces his allegiance to Jesus; while he does the former, he refuses to do the latter. Diana stands with Marcellus and denounces Caligula, who declares that the couple will die together. As they depart the courtroom, Diana hands Jesus' robe to Marcipor, telling him to give it to Peter. Marcellus and Diana are led away to begin eternal life together in the kingdom of their true king .",

Dawson and Downey refuse the plea bargain, insisting that Kendrick gave them the \"code red\" order, they never intended to kill Santiago, and a plea bargain would be dishonorable. Initially intending to get removed as counsel, at the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly pleads not guilty for the defendants. Realizing that he was chosen to handle the case to accept a plea to keep the matter quiet, he decides to put up a defense. Markinson meets Kaffee in secret and says that Jessep never ordered a transfer for Santiago. The defense establishes that Dawson had received a negative performance review from Kendrick and had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been restricted to water and vitamins. Dawson had been punished for disobeying an illegal order, and the defense, through Downey, proves that illegal \"code reds\" had been ordered before. However, under cross-examination, Downey admits he was not present when Dawson received the supposed \"code red\" order. Ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command and unwilling to testify against Jessep, his longtime friend, Markinson commits suicide before he can testify. Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case, risking long sentences for Dawson and Downey, instead of accepting a lenient deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessep as a witness, despite risking court-martial for challenging a high-ranking officer without evidence. At the Washington Navy Yard court, Jessep spars with Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee―springing a trap―points out a contradiction in his testimony that Guantanamo marines would never disobey an order to \"not touch Santiago\" yet he ordered Santiago off the base fearing for Santiago's safety. Kaffee also questions Jessep's claim that Santiago was to be put on the first flight home. Upon further questioning, and frustrated by Kaffee's attitude, Jessep extols the military's, and his own, importance to national security, exclaiming \"You can't handle the truth!\" Challenging Jessep's indignation, Kaffee pointedly asks if Jessep ordered the \"code red\", to which Jessep bellows \"You're goddamn right I did!\" Jessep tries leaving the courtroom, but he's arrested before he can do so, and attempts to assault Kaffee. He's restrained and subsequently leaves. Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges but found guilty of \" conduct unbecoming \" and will be dishonorably discharged . Downey does not understand what they did wrong; Dawson says that they failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves. Kaffee tells Dawson that it is not necessary to wear a patch on one's arm to have honor. Dawson acknowledges Kaffee as an officer by rendering a salute. Kaffee and Ross exchange pleasantries before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.",

    "obfuscated_plot": "At a military base in a tropical location, a young soldier is tied up and beaten in the middle of the night. After he is found dead, two lower-ranking soldiers are accused of his murder and face a court-martial. Their defense is assigned to a young, inexperienced lawyer with an impressive track record for plea bargains. Another attorney, his superior, suspects something is amiss. The deceased soldier died after he broke the chain of command to ask for a transfer. A senior officer advocated for the soldier's transfer, but the base commander ordered the soldier's platoon commander to \"train\" him. The superior attorney suspects that the two accused soldiers carried out an extrajudicial violent punishment. The lawyer and the superior attorney question the base commander and others, and are met with contempt. The lawyer initially negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor for a reduced sentence, but the accused soldiers refuse, insisting they never intended to kill the victim and that a plea would be dishonorable. \n\nThe defense establishes that one soldier had received a negative performance review and been denied promotion for a previous incident. They prove that illegal punishments had been ordered before. However, under cross-examination, a critical piece of testimony is weakened. A senior officer, ashamed of his failure to protect the victim and unwilling to testify against his friend, commits suicide before he can testify.\n\nAt the military court, the lawyer calls the base commander as a witness. Through careful questioning, the lawyer exposes contradictions in the commander's testimony. Frustrated and challenged, the commander ultimately admits to ordering the violent punishment, shouting about the necessities of military discipline. The commander is arrested and attempts to assault the lawyer.\n\nThe two accused soldiers are cleared of murder but found guilty of misconduct and are dishonorably discharged. The lawyer explains that honor is not about wearing a uniform, but about defending those who cannot defend themselves. The case concludes with a symbolic salute and the arrest of the platoon commander."

He tries unsuccessfully to gain an interview and audition with Leopold Stokowski , but not to disappoint his daughter, Patricia (Patsy), he tells her that he has managed to get the job with Stokowski's orchestra. Patsy soon learns the truth after sneaking into a rehearsal, and also learning that her father, desperate for rent money, has used some of the cash in a lady's evening bag he has found to pay his debts. The irrepressible and wilful Patsy seeks an interview with Mrs. Frost, whose bag it was, and confesses her father's actions. Mrs. Frost, a society matron and wife of rich radio station owner John R. Frost, lightheartedly offers to sponsor an orchestra of unemployed musicians. Taking her at her word, Patsy and her father recruit 100 musicians, rent a garage space and start to rehearse. Realizing that Patsy took her seriously, Mrs. Frost flees to Europe. Mr. Frost tells John and his friends that he will not sponsor them, as they had supposed, unless they can attract a well-recognized guest conductor to give them a 'name' and launch them on their opening night. Patsy, undaunted, sets out to recruit none other than Leopold Stokowski to be that conductor. Stokowski at first definitely refuses—though when Patsy sings as the orchestra is rehearsing Mozart 's \"Alleluia\" from Exsultate, jubilate , he strongly suggests that she seek professional voice training and eventual representation. By mistake, Patsy conveys the story to a newspaper music critic that Stokowski will conduct an orchestra of unemployed musicians, and that John R. Frost would broadcast the concert on the radio. When the story breaks, Frost protests his embarrassment to his friends, but they suggest valuable publicity would result. Frost immediately signs the one-hundred-man orchestra to a contract, though Patsy tries to tell them that Stokowski has not agreed. Stokowski is astonished and offended at the news, but Patsy enters Stokowski's palatial house surreptitiously, along with the entire orchestra. She apologizes to him and insists that he listen to the players. The conductor is so moved by their performance of Liszt 's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 that he postpones a European tour and agrees to the engagement. The concert is a rousing success for everyone, especially when Patsy, called upon to make a speech, instead agrees to sing the \"Brindisi\" (Drinking Song) from Verdi 's opera La traviata .",

    "plot": "On the French Riviera , Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on. Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter.  Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, such as tennis lessons, which she conceals from her employer. The young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. Upon her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction, because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley . Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall . Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman, a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, who she views as an usurper. Danvers feeds the bride's insecurity by showing her Rebecca's lavish bedroom suite, left untouched and denied to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house with Rebecca's monogram. Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca's glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim's ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca's body in it has been discovered. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim's line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her naïve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell's accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him. As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.",

A tyrant haunted by dread, Paul lives in constant suspicion of everyone around him, believing that he, like some of his ancestors, is doomed to be assassinated. Despite his mistrustful nature, he places intermittent trust in one man: Count Pahlen (Lewis Stone), his Prime Minister. Pahlen skillfully manages the emperor like a child, maintaining an unassailable political position. Privately, Pahlen is in love with Countess Ostermann (Florence Vidor), the wife of a military officer. Their affair is interrupted when her husband unexpectedly returns. As he picks up one of Pahlen’s boots to hurl it out the window in a rage, he is shot and killed by a Cossack guard—one of the Tsar’s decrees forbids anyone from being visible at a window during his passage. While Pahlen is deeply loyal to Russia, he is also tormented by the suffering Paul inflicts on the nation. Torn between duty and patriotism, he determines to bring about the Tsar’s downfall. He recruits Stephan (Harry Cording), a soldier recently punished by Paul for minor uniform violations, promising him vengeance and assigning him as his bodyguard. At St. Michael’s Castle, Paul obsesses over trivialities like the number of gaiter buttons, while foreign and domestic affairs languish. Meanwhile, Pahlen begins to rally conspirators at court. He appeals to Crown Prince Alexander (Neil Hamilton), an idealist who dreams of a better Russia. But when the prince refuses to support treason, Pahlen reports him to Paul as a traitor, knowing full well the emperor already resents the popularity of his own son. Paul immediately places Alexander under arrest. With the conspiracy in motion, Pahlen devises a plan: Paul will be pressured to abdicate, and if he refuses, he will be assassinated. But Paul suddenly announces he is leaving the city with his mistress, Mademoiselle Lapoukhine (Vera Voronina), derailing the carefully timed plot. To keep Paul in the capital, Pahlen shows him a snuff box with a hidden portrait of Countess Ostermann. Obsessed, Paul cancels his trip and demands to meet the Countess. Pahlen orchestrates the meeting and deliberately leaves the two alone. Paul clumsily propositions her. Betrayed and disgusted, the Countess reveals Pahlen’s plot to assassinate him. Summoning Pahlen, Paul demands an explanation. Calmly, Pahlen claims he infiltrated the conspiracy to expose the plotters. He offers his life in exchange for the Tsar’s trust.

Martha has invited a young married couple she met at the party for a drink. The guests arrive—Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey—just before 2:30 a.m. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in back and forth scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later entangled. Martha angers George by telling Honey about their son, who will celebrate his 16th birthday the next day. Martha's divulging of this information sets off another fight between the two and the women leave the room. Alone with George, Nick confesses that he was attracted to Honey for her family's money and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and, years later, his father and lived out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits that he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start. When their guests propose leaving, a drunken George insists on driving them home. They approach a roadhouse , and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Martha suggestively dances with Nick while continually mocking George. George finally unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished novel, prompting George to physically attack Martha until Nick pulls him away. George comments that since they've already played \"humiliate the host\", they should try playing \"hump the hostess\" or \"get the guests\". He also mentions that he's written a second novel about a teacher and his wife who marry because of her false pregnancy and family money. Honey realizes Nick has told George about their past and runs from the room. Another argument leads Martha to drive off with Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot. He arrives to see the silhouettes of Martha and Nick together in the bedroom window and Honey distraught in the front yard. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real and that she secretly had an abortion . Inside, Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, which he blames on the large amount of liquor he has consumed. With the quartet together again, Martha and George resume arguing about their son,  with each making lurid accusations about how the other negatively affected him. George finally ends the back and forth by dramatically announcing that he has received a telegram saying their son has been killed in a car accident. As Martha begs George not to \"kill\" their son, Nick realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children and filled the void with an imaginary son. George explains that their one mutually agreed upon rule was to never mention the son to anyone else, and that he \"killed\" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey. The young couple departs awkwardly at dawn, leaving George and Martha alone. George starts singing the song \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", and Martha responds, \"I am, George, I am\", while the two hold hands.",

    "plot": "Late one night, a drunken Brick Pollitt is on a track field trying to recapture his glory days of high school sports by leaping hurdles, reminiscing about his moments as a youthful athlete. He breaks his ankle, leaving him dependent on a crutch. The next day, Brick and his wife Maggie (\"the Cat\") visit his family's plantation in the Mississippi Delta to celebrate the 65th birthday of Brick's father, Big Daddy. Depressed, Brick has spent the last few years drinking while resisting the affections of his wife, who shares with him her worries about the inheritance of Big Daddy's wealth. There is speculation in the family about why Maggie is childless, while Brick's brother Gooper and his wife Mae have five children and another on the way. Big Daddy and Big Mama arrive home from the hospital by private airplane and are greeted by Gooper, Mae, and their children, along with Maggie. Annoyed by the rehearsed display that his grandchildren gave him, Big Daddy ignores them and drives to the house with Maggie. The news is that Big Daddy is not dying of cancer . However, his doctor meets privately, first with Gooper and then with Brick, to divulge that it is a deception: Big Daddy has inoperable cancer and will likely be dead within a year, and the truth is being kept from him, as well as from all the women in the family. Brick reveals this to Maggie, and she is heartbroken. Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his father for both unselfish and selfish reasons, but he stubbornly refuses. As the party winds down, Big Daddy meets with Brick in his room, and says that he is fed up with Brick's behavior and alcoholism, demanding to know why he is so stubborn. At one point, Maggie joins them and, at Brick's insistence, reveals what happened a few years ago, on the night when Brick's best friend and football teammate, Skipper, took his life. Maggie was jealous of Skipper because he had more of Brick's time. She explains that Brick's infatuation with Skipper was misguided, as Skipper was far less good on the field and in life than Brick wanted to believe, and Skipper depended on Brick much more than Brick depended on Skipper. She says that Skipper was lost without Brick at his side. She thought about ruining their relationship \"by any means necessary\". To this end, she considered making love with Skipper, and use this information to let her husband question Skipper's loyalty. However, when she found herself in Skipper's hotel bedroom, she realized that she could have lost Brick instead, she changed her mind and ran away. That very same night, Skipper phoned Brick falsely claiming to have made love with Maggie. Since then, Brick had blamed Maggie for infidelity, hence refusing making love to her. Also, Brick had blamed himself for not having answered further phone calls from Skipper that night, hence his self-destruction with alcohol out of sense of guilt for Skipper's death. After an argument, Brick lets it slip to Big Daddy that Big Daddy will die of cancer, and that this birthday will be his last. Shaken, Big Daddy retreats to the cellar. Meanwhile, Gooper, who is a lawyer, and his wife Mae argue with Big Mama about the family's cotton business and Big Daddy's will, which Gooper, egged on by the scheming Mae, plans to use to cut Brick and Maggie out of the family fortune.

    "plot": "In 1963 Oregon, Randle McMurphy is incarcerated for the statutory rape of a 15-year-old girl (which he claims he committed under the assumption that she was an 18-year-old), with five previous arrests for assault. He feigns mental illness so that he can be moved to a mental institution and avoid hard labor at a work farm . The medical ward is dominated by the cold, passive-aggressive Nurse Ratched , who intimidates her patients and maintains control through fear. The other patients include young, anxious, stuttering Billy Bibbit; Charlie Cheswick, who is prone to temper tantrums; delusional, child-like Martini; the articulate and repressed Dale Harding; belligerent and profane Max Taber; epileptics Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson; quiet but violent-minded Scanlon; tall, deaf-mute Native American Chief Bromden; and several others with chronic conditions. Ratched sees McMurphy's lively, rebellious presence as a threat to her authority, to which she responds by confiscating and rationing the patients' cigarettes and suspending their card-playing privileges. McMurphy finds himself in a battle of wills against Ratched. One night, he makes a bet with the other inmates that he can escape by tearing a hydrotherapy fountain off its base and hurling it through a locked window, but is predictably unable to lift it. Shortly after, he hijacks a charter bus, picks up his girlfriend Candy, and escapes with several patients to steal a recreational fishing boat, exposing them to the outside world and encouraging them to discover their abilities and find self-confidence. After an orderly tells him that his sentence term does not apply in the mental institution, and can become indefinite, McMurphy questions why no one had told him this before. He also learns that he, Chief, and Taber are the only non-chronic patients who have been involuntarily committed; the others have committed themselves voluntarily but are too afraid to leave. After Cheswick bursts into a fit and demands his cigarettes from Ratched, McMurphy starts a fight with the orderlies, and Chief intervenes to help him. McMurphy, Chief, and Cheswick are then sent to the disturbed ward, and Chief reveals to McMurphy that he can speak and hear normally, having faked deaf-muteness to avoid engaging with anyone. The two make plans to escape to Canada together. McMurphy is subjected to electroconvulsive therapy , and returns to the ward pretending to be brain-damaged before revealing that the treatment has made him even more determined to defeat Ratched. McMurphy and Chief plan to throw a secret Christmas party for their friends after Ratched and the orderlies leave for the night, before making their escape. McMurphy sneaks Candy and her friend Rose into the ward, each bringing bottles of alcohol for the party, and bribes the night orderly Turkle to allow the party. McMurphy and Chief prepare to escape, inviting Billy to come with them. Billy refuses but asks for a \"date\" with Candy; McMurphy arranges for him to spend a night with her. McMurphy and the others get drunk, and McMurphy falls asleep instead of escaping with Chief. Ratched arrives in the morning to find the ward in disarray; most patients have passed out. She discovers Billy and Candy in bed together and aims to embarrass Billy in front of everyone. Billy manages to overcome his stutter and stands up to Ratched. When she threatens to tell his mother, Billy cracks under the pressure and reverts to stuttering, before Ratched orders he be locked in a separate room as punishment. McMurphy punches an orderly when trying to escape out of a window with Chief, causing the other orderlies to intervene. Locked up alone, Billy kills himself by slitting his throat with a broken glass, causing a huge commotion. Ratched tries to control the situation by calling for the day's routine to continue as usual, but her nonchalant reaction enrages McMurphy, who begins strangling her. The orderlies violently subdue McMurphy, saving Ratched's life. Sometime later, Ratched is wearing a neck brace and speaking weakly although still sternly, and Harding leads the now unsuspended card-playing. McMurphy is nowhere to be found, leading to a rumor that he has escaped. Later that night, Chief sees McMurphy being returned to his bed. He is initially elated that McMurphy had kept his promise not to escape without him, until discovering that McMurphy has been lobotomized . After tearfully embracing McMurphy, Chief smothers him to death with a pillow. He then rips the hydrotherapy fountain off its base and throws it through the window as McMurphy had earlier attempted. Chief escapes, with Taber and the other inmates awakening to cheer him on as he runs into the surrounding countryside.",

    "plot": "In 1932, Sir William McCordle, his wife Lady Sylvia, and their daughter Isobel host a shooting party at their country estate, Gosford Park. Among the guests are Sylvia's sisters Louisa and Lavinia, and their husbands Lord Stockbridge and Commander Anthony Meredith; her aunt Constance, Countess of Trentham; the Hon. Freddie and Mabel Nesbitt; actor Ivor Novello and American film producer Morris Weissman. Lord Rupert Standish and Jeremy Blond arrive later. Mrs Wilson, the housekeeper, assigns the visiting servants to their rooms and overhears Robert Parks, Lord Stockbridge's valet, mention being raised in an orphanage. Head housemaid Elsie tutors Lady Trentham's inexperienced maid, Mary MacEachran. Following dinner, a silver carving knife is missing. Henry Denton, Weissman's valet, raises the staff's suspicions with intrusive questions and a seemingly Scottish accent (which Mary, Scottish herself, sees through). Later that evening, Henry has a tryst with Lady Sylvia. Isobel asks Elsie to speak to Sir William about hiring Freddie, who is blackmailing Isobel over their affair and her aborted pregnancy. Freddie mistreats Mabel, whom he married for her money but overestimated her wealth. Lady Trentham confides to Mary that Sylvia and Louisa cut cards to decide which of them would marry Sir William. When the men go shooting, a stray shot grazes Sir William's ear. The ladies join them for lunch, and Sir William withdraws from Anthony's business scheme, leaving him financially ruined. Lady Sylvia informs her aunt Constance that Sir William may halt her allowance. During dinner, Lady Sylvia berates Sir William and Elsie comes to his defence, inadvertently exposing their affair. After dinner, Sir William retires alone to his study for the rest of the evening, where Mrs Wilson brings him coffee. The guests gather in the drawing room as Novello plays the piano and sings, with the servants listening outside; Freddie, Anthony, Robert, and footman George each slip away. A man, seen only by his trousers, puts on muddy galoshes left by one of the shooting party. The man enters the library with the missing carving knife and, finding Sir William seemingly asleep in his chair, stabs him in the chest. After the body is discovered, bumbling Inspector Thompson and competent Constable Dexter arrive to investigate. It is discovered that Sir William was poisoned before being stabbed. Mrs Croft, the head cook, tells her staff about Sir William's history of seducing his female factory workers; those who became pregnant were forced to give their babies up for adoption or lose their jobs. Isobel gives Freddie a cheque, which he angrily tears up when confronted by Mabel. Inspector Thompson releases the guests without interviewing most of the staff. Mary deduces that Lord Stockbridge's valet is the killer. When she confronts Parks, he reveals that he is the illegitimate son of Sir William and that his mother was one of his factory workers who died soon after Sir William turned him over to an orphanage. It also becomes clear that since Parks did not poison Sir William, he must already have been dead when he was stabbed. Parks tells Mary that he is glad that Sir William is dead and does not care who was responsible. As the guests and their servants depart, Freddie, his blackmail scheme with Isobel having failed, pursues a partnership with Anthony, whose business venture has been saved by Sir William's death. Despite his fondness for her, Rupert's courtship of Isobel is abruptly ended when she overhears his conversation with Mr Blond about the limits on her inheritance. Lady Trentham and Lady Sylvia discuss Mrs Croft and Mrs Wilson's long-standing feud, and Lady Sylvia reveals that Mrs Wilson's surname used to be Parks. Mary speaks to Mrs Wilson, who admits that she and Mrs Croft are sisters and both had children by Sir William while working at his factory. Mrs Croft kept her baby and lost her job, though the child died in infancy, while Mrs Wilson gave up Robert (Parks). Realizing Parks was her son and that he intended to kill his father, she poisoned Sir William to ensure his only crime would be stabbing a dead body. Mrs Croft comforts Mrs Wilson as Mary says goodbye to Robert, and the last guests leave.",

Valjean attempts to steal his silverware and is captured, but the bishop claims he gave him the silver and tells him to use it to begin an honest life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole and assumes a new identity, intending to redeem others. Eight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais . He is startled when Javert , formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Witnessing Valjean rescue a worker trapped under a cart makes Javert suspect the former's true identity. Meanwhile, one of Valjean's workers, Fantine , is fired by the foreman when she is revealed to have an illegitimate daughter, Cosette , living with the greedy Thénardier family, to whom Fantine sends her earnings. Out on the streets and increasingly unwell, Fantine sells her hair, teeth, and eventually becomes a prostitute to support Cosette. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean recognises her and takes her to the hospital, much to Javert's suspicion and anger.

The first family felt Homer was too quiet (due to orphanage babies soon learning that crying is pointless). The second beat him. Dr. Larch is addicted to ether , and he secretly performs abortions. Conditions at the orphanage are sparse, but the children have love and respect, and they are like an extended family. Older children, such as Buster, look out for the younger children, and in particular care for those who are sickly, including Fuzzy Stone, who was born prematurely to an alcoholic mother. Fuzzy suffers from respiratory disease and thus spends most of his time beneath a plastic tent ventilated with a breathing apparatus. Each night before sleeping, Dr. Larch says to the children \"Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!\" as both an encouragement and a kind of blessing. Homer, the oldest of the orphans, is very bright, helpful and even-tempered, so Larch trains him in obstetrics and abortions as an apprentice despite Homer's never having attended high school. Homer disapproves of abortions, and although Larch has trained him, Homer refuses to perform them. After several years, Homer is very skillful and confident in performing obstetrical duties. Larch wants Homer to take over after Larch retires, but Homer feels it's impossible, as he lacks formal medical education and he wants to see the outside world beyond the orphanage. Dr. Larch performs an abortion on Candy Kendall, accompanied by her boyfriend, Wally Worthington, air-force pilot on leave from service. Wally's mother, Olive, owns the Worthington family apple orchard estate where Homer lives as a worker of the estate's Cider bunkhouse. While Wally returns to his World War II service, Homer is exempt thereof, diagnosed by Dr. Larch as heart condition patient. While Wally is away, Candy starts flirting with Homer, that leads to an affair. Homer picks apples with Arthur Rose's team of migrant workers, employed seasonally at the orchard. A list of rules for its occupants is posted in the Cider House, which its migrant illiterate workers fail to read and have never complied with. Homer reads them the list, which the workers can now observe or ignore as they wish. Homer and Candy become much closer during harvest and spend more time together while Wally is fighting in Burma. Meanwhile, at St. Cloud's, Fuzzy Stone succumbs to his illness and dies. Dr. Larch and the staff conceal his death from the other orphans, telling them that Fuzzy was adopted. After Arthur and his team return to the orchard the following season, Homer discovers that Rose, Arthur's daughter, is pregnant. Candy learns that the baby's father is Arthur. Homer decides to abort Rose's baby with Arthur's assistance. A few days later, Rose tries to run away. When Arthur tries to say goodbye to her, she stabs him and flees. He then makes the injury worse, and as a last request, asks Homer and another worker to tell the police his death was a suicide. Wally returns from Burma a paraplegic. Although Candy loves Homer, she decides to take care of Wally. Immediately after this, Homer learns Dr. Larch has died from an accidental overdose of ether. Homer decides he is most needed back at the orphanage. When he returns, he is greeted joyously by both the children and staff. He learns that not only did Larch fake Homer's medical record to keep him out of the war, but he also faked college credentials and used reverse psychology to convince the orphanage board to appoint Homer as the next director. Homer fills the paternal role that Larch previously held for the children of the orphanage, telling them, \"Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!\"",

His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve, Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert, former Israeli soldier and \" cleaner \" Carl, and German antique dealer and document forger Hans from Frankfurt .

With IDF commandos, they pursue three Palestinian militants— Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar , Kamal Adwan , and Kamal Nasser —to Beirut , penetrate the Palestinians' guarded compound and kill all three. Between hits, the assassins argue with each other about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as their apparent ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens , when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safe house with their rival PLO members and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be members of foreign militant groups like ETA , IRA , ANC , and the Red Army Faction .

His attempt to keep the article from the eyes of the other guests at the residential hotel only succeeds in heightening their awareness of it, particularly the strict Mrs Railton-Bell and the more relaxed and compassionate Lady Matheson. The two women read in the paper that Major Pollock has pleaded guilty to sexually harassing several young women in a theatre. However the filed complaints are, in themselves, questionable. Mrs Railton-Bell wants Major Pollock expelled from the hotel and holds a meeting with other long-term residents to decide the issue before presenting it to the manager, Miss Pat Cooper. Mrs Railton-Bell leads the meeting arguing for the Major's expulsion, and despite the opposing views of the other residents, she informs Miss Cooper that the Major must leave. Anne and John, who were formerly married to each other, meet outside. Anne coolly teases John, informing him that she is engaged; John tells her he is engaged as well, but does not disclose that he is engaged to Miss Cooper. John claims that though Anne could have married other men who were wealthier and more important, she chose him, a man in a lower economic class, in order to manipulate and degrade him fully. Despite this, John and Anne admit they are still attracted to each other. She asks him to come to her room. As they walk into the hotel, Miss Cooper tells Anne she has a phone call. Miss Cooper asks John, knowing Anne is his ex-wife, to consider the real reason for Anne's visit. John defends Anne at first, claiming that all his misfortunes are his own fault, but changes his mind when Miss Cooper tells him that Anne is talking on the phone to his publisher, the only person who knows that John and Miss Cooper are engaged. John confronts Anne in her bedroom. When she attempts to seduce him, he cruelly tells her that, in the light, he can see that she has aged and without her physical beauty it will be impossible for her to continue to manipulate people. She begs him to stay, but he runs out of the hotel after striking her. Anne has an emotional breakdown, and Miss Cooper comforts her. Anne reveals that she is not really engaged and has been abusing sleeping pills to ease her pain, even during the day. The next morning, Mrs Railton-Bell's downtrodden daughter Sibyl tells Major Pollock that she knows what he did. He explains that he always has been fearful of people and that it is easier for him to attempt to be familiar with strangers. Major Pollock tells Sibyl that he and she get along well with each other because they are both afraid of life. As he returns to his room to pack, Sibyl worries he will not find a new home. When John returns in the morning, Miss Cooper tells him that Anne is emotionally unwell, and asks him to see her before she checks out of the hotel.

    "obfuscated_plot": "In a coastal town, at a residential hotel, a retired military officer tries but fails to hide a newspaper article about himself. His attempt to keep the article from the eyes of the other guests only succeeds in heightening their awareness of it, particularly a strict elderly woman and a more compassionate older lady. The two women read in the paper that the military officer has pleaded guilty to sexually harassing several young women in a theatre. However, the filed complaints are, in themselves, questionable. The strict elderly woman wants the military officer expelled from the hotel and holds a meeting with other long-term residents to decide the issue before presenting it to the manager, a female staff member. The elderly woman leads the meeting arguing for his expulsion, and despite the opposing views of the other residents, she informs the manager that the military officer must leave.\n\nA divorced couple meets outside. The ex-wife coolly teases her former husband, informing him that she is engaged; he tells her he is engaged as well, but does not disclose that he is engaged to the hotel manager. He claims that though she could have married other men who were wealthier and more important, she chose him, a man in a lower economic class, in order to manipulate and degrade him fully. Despite this, they admit they are still attracted to each other. She asks him to come to her room.\n\nAs they walk into the hotel, the manager tells the ex-wife she has a phone call. The manager asks her former husband, knowing the dynamics between the ex-spouses, to consider the real reason for her visit. He defends her at first, claiming that all his misfortunes are his own fault, but changes his mind when the manager tells him that his ex-wife is talking on the phone to his publisher, the only person who knows that he and the manager are engaged.\n\nHe confronts his ex-wife in her bedroom. When she attempts to seduce him, he cruelly tells her that, in the light, he can see that she has aged and without her physical beauty it will be impossible for her to continue to manipulate people. She begs him to stay, but he runs out of the hotel after striking her. The ex-wife has an emotional breakdown, and the manager comforts her. She reveals that she is not really engaged and has been abusing sleeping pills to ease her pain, even during the day.\n\nThe next morning, the elderly woman's downtrodden daughter tells the military officer that she knows what he did. He explains that he has always been fearful of people and that it is easier for him to attempt to be familiar with strangers. He tells her that they get along well with each other because they are both afraid of life. As he returns to his room to pack, she worries he will not find a new home.\n\nWhen the ex-husband returns in the morning, the manager tells him that his ex-wife is emotionally unwell, and asks him to see her before she checks out of the hotel. After he leaves, the manager attempts to persuade the military officer to stay, but he refuses. When the military officer enters the dining room, there is an awkward silence until the ex-husband greets him. The others do the same and cheerfully converse with him.\n\nThe elderly woman is angered by this and demands her daughter leave with her.

Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus , is unfit to rule and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent , to restore the Roman Republic . Angered by this decision, Commodus secretly assassinates his father. Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested by Praetorian Guards led by Quintus, who tells him that he and his family will die. Maximus kills his captors and, wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium , where he finds his wife and son murdered. Maximus buries them and collapses from his injuries. He is found by slave traders, who take him to Zuccabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis and sell him to the gladiator trainer Proximo. Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He earns the nickname \"the Spaniard \" and befriends Juba, a gladiator from Carthage , and Hagen, a gladiator from Germania . In Rome , Commodus organizes 150 days of gladiatorial games to commemorate his father and win the approval of the Roman public . Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to \"win the crowd\" to gain his freedom. Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum . Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the arena as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama . Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory and wins the crowd's support. Commodus and his young nephew, Lucius, enter the Colosseum to offer their congratulations. Seeing Lucius, Maximus refrains from attacking Commodus, who orders him to reveal his identity. Maximus removes his helmet and declares his intent to seek vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus live. That evening, Maximus is visited by Lucilla , his former lover and Commodus' sister. Distrusting her, Maximus refuses her help. Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris of Gaul , an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus, but he prevails. At the crowd's desire, Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his life in defiance. In response, the crowd chants \"Maximus the Merciful\", angering Commodus. To provoke Maximus, Commodus taunts him about the murder of his family, but Maximus resists the urge to strike him. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have every senator followed, and refuses to have Maximus killed for fear he will become a martyr . Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex- orderly , that his former legions remain loyal to him. He secretly meets with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions in Ostia , oust Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate . The Praetorians arrest Gracchus. Lucilla meets Maximus at night to arrange his escape; they share a kiss. Commodus becomes suspicious when Lucius innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape, but Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed. Commodus demands that Lucilla provide him with an heir. He challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum to win back public approval and stabs him before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injury, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After Quintus and the Praetorians refuse to help him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him.

When the prison officials suggest that the condemned man owes the state a debt, Father Flanagan witnesses the condemned man's diatribe to prison officials and a reporter that describes his awful plight as a homeless and friendless boy who was a ward in state institutions. After the convicted man asks the officials to leave, Father Flanagan provides some comfort and wisdom. On the train back to Omaha, Father Flanagan is transformed in his humanitarian mission by revelations (echoed in the words) imparted by the condemned man's litany of hardships suffered as a child, without friends or family, and a ward of the state. Father Flanagan believes there is no such thing as a bad boy and spends his life attempting to prove it. He battles indifference, the legal system, and often even the boys, to build a sanctuary that he calls Boys Town. The boys have their own government, make their own rules, and dish out their own punishment. One boy, Whitey Marsh, is as much as anyone can handle. Whitey's elder brother Joe, in prison for murder, asks Father Flanagan to take Whitey—a poolroom shark and tough-talking hoodlum—to Boys Town. Joe escapes custody during transfer to federal prison. Whitey stays, though, and runs for mayor of Boys Town, determined to win with his \"don't be a sucker\" campaign slogan. Winning the election for mayor is Tony Ponessa, a disabled boy. Whitey has an outburst after finding out the results. This nearly causes a fist fight between Whitey and outgoing mayor Freddie Fuller. Since Whitey's arrival at Boys Town, he and Freddie do not get along well. To settle their differences once and for all, a boxing match is held.

Pee Wee, the Boys Town mascot, catches up with him and pulls on his sleeve, pleading, \"We're going to be pals, ain't we?\" Whitey, nearly in tears, refuses and pushes the child to the ground and tells him to go back. He storms across the highway as Pee Wee, crying and wandering blindly in the road, is suddenly hit by a car. Whitey leaves, feeling guilty and hurt. During an aimless walk in downtown Omaha, Whitey runs into his brother Joe, who mistakenly shoots him in the leg.

    "plot": "Arthur Fleck is a party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Penny, in a crime- and recession -ridden Gotham City . He suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication he depends on social services to obtain. After Arthur is attacked by street youths while on the job, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver to defend himself. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club. Arthur accidentally drops his gun while performing at a children's hospital. Randall does not admit he gave the gun to Arthur, leading to Arthur's firing. While riding home on the subway and still wearing his clown make-up, he is mocked and assaulted by three drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments . He fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. Their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne , condemns the killings, but supporters begin sporting clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social services program, leaving Arthur without his medication. Sophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which fails due to his disorder and his jokes falling flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas indicating that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth of his parentage. He goes to Wayne Manor , where he meets Thomas's young son Bruce , but flees after a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth . Penny suffers a stroke after being questioned by two detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the subway murders, and is hospitalized. Arthur's idol, popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthur's failed performance on his show and mockingly calls him a \"joker\", much to Arthur's distress. Arthur confronts Thomas at a movie theatre. Thomas denies being his father, claiming that Penny also is not his biological mother. Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and reads Penny's file, which states she was a delusional narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes. She developed an imaginary intimate relationship with Thomas, which included Arthur being their biological son. At the same time, Penny raised Arthur with a boyfriend who physically and sexually abused them, leading to his neurological disorder. A distraught Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, she kindly asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital. Due to the fame caused by the clips of his performance, Arthur is invited onto Murray's show. Arthur decides to bring the gun, intending to kill himself on live TV.

The detectives investigating Arthur pursue him onto a train filled with clown protesters. Arthur incites a brawl, during which one detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester. The other protesters, in turn, beat the detectives while Arthur escapes. At the studio, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as \" Joker \", a reference to his earlier mockery. As the show broadcasts live, Arthur tells morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about societal neglect of the downtrodden, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After a final joke, Arthur fatally shoots Murray in the head. Arthur is arrested, and riots erupt across the city. Looters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. Meanwhile, one rioter corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha in front of Bruce. Arthur stands on the police car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears the blood on his face into a smile. Sometime later at Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke during a session with his new therapist. He declines telling it to her, claiming she would not understand it.

His mission is to collect a shipload of breadfruit saplings and transport them to Jamaica . The government hopes the plants will thrive and provide a cheap source of food for the slaves. The voyage gets off to a difficult start with the discovery that some cheese is missing. Seaman John Mills accuses Bligh, the true pilferer, and Bligh has Mills brutally flogged for showing contempt to his superior officer, to the disgust of his second-in-command, First Lieutenant Fletcher Christian . Bligh tries to reach Tahiti sooner by attempting the shorter westbound route around Cape Horn . The strategy fails and the Bounty backtracks eastward, costing the mission much precious time. Singlemindedly, Bligh makes up the lost time by pushing the crew harder and cutting their rations. When the Bounty reaches her destination, the crew revels in the easygoing life of the tropical paradise – and in the free-love philosophies of the Tahitian women. Christian himself is smitten with Maimiti, daughter of the Tahitian king. Bligh's agitation is further fueled by the fact that the dormancy period of the breadfruit means more months of delay until the plants can be potted. As departure day nears, three men, including seaman Mills, attempt to desert but are caught by Christian and clapped in irons by Bligh. On the voyage to Jamaica, Bligh attempts to bring back twice the number of breadfruit plants to atone his tardiness, and reduce the water rations of the crew to water the extra plants. One member of the crew falls from the rigging to his death while attempting to retrieve the drinking ladle, as the other assaults Bligh and is fatally keelhauled . Mills taunts Christian after each death, trying to egg him on to challenge Bligh. When a crewman becomes gravely ill from drinking seawater, Christian attempts to give him fresh water, in violation of the Captain's orders. Bligh strikes Christian when he ignores his second order to stop. In response, Christian strikes Bligh. Bligh informs Christian that he will hang for his actions when they reach port. With nothing left to lose, Christian takes command of the ship and sets Bligh and the loyalist members of the crew adrift in the longboat with a compass and meager rations, telling them to make for the island of Tofua . Bligh, bent on revenge, avoids Tofua and the rest of the islands by lying to his loyalists about the locals there practicing cannibalism , and instead crossing the Pacific westward in order to reach the Dutch colony of Kupang at the island of Timor . He returns to Britain with remarkable speed and weeks later, a court martial exonerates Bligh of any misdeeds for the loss of the Bounty and recommends an expedition to arrest the mutineers and bring them to trial.  The court also comes to the conclusion that the appointment of Bligh as Captain of the Bounty was a mistake.  This conclusion is based on the fact that several superb officers with commendable records participated in the mutiny against him. In the meantime, Christian sails back to Tahiti to pick up supplies, Maimiti and the girlfriends of the crew. They sail to several islands until they reach Pitcairn Island , which is marked incorrectly on the charts and would be virtually impossible for the British Navy to find because all charts reflect the same error. However, once on Pitcairn, Christian decides that it is their duty to return to Britain and testify to Bligh's wrongdoing, and he asks his men to sail with him. To prevent this possibility, Mills and the rest set the Bounty on fire and Christian is fatally burned after retrieving (and eventually losing) the ship's sextant. Christian dies in Maimiti's arms as the Bounty burns and sinks.",

His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife, Elizabeth , persuades him to see Australian-born Lionel Logue , a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist . Bertie believes the first session is not going well, but Lionel has him recite Hamlet 's \" To be, or not to be \" soliloquy while listening to classical music over a pair of headphones. Bertie is frustrated but Lionel gives him the acetate recording that he has made of the reading as a souvenir. After Bertie's father, King George V, broadcasts his 1934 Royal Christmas Message , he explains to Bertie that the wireless will play a significant part in the role of the royal family, allowing them to enter the homes of the people, and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities makes training in it necessary. The attempt at reading the message himself is a failure, but Bertie plays the recording Lionel gave him that night and is astonished at the lack of stutter. He returns for daily treatments to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his stutter. George V dies in 1936 . His eldest son David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII . A constitutional crisis arises with Edward over a prospective marriage with twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . Edward, as the supreme governor of the Church of England , cannot marry her, even if her second divorce occurs, since both her previous husbands are alive. At an unscheduled session, Bertie expresses frustration that, while his speech has mostly improved, he still stammers when talking to David, simultaneously revealing the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie himself could make a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of treason and angrily quits Lionel. They reconvene after King Edward decides to abdicate to marry. Bertie, urged by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , ascends the throne as King George VI and visits Lionel's home with his wife before their coronation , much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she learns who Lionel's client has been. Bertie and Lionel's relationship is questioned by the King's advisors during preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey . The archbishop of Canterbury , Cosmo Gordon Lang , points out that George never sought advice from his advisors about his treatment and that Lionel lacks formal training. Lionel explains to an outraged Bertie that at the time he started with speech defects there were no formal qualifications and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War Australian soldiers who suffered from shell-shock . Bertie remains unconvinced until provoked to protest at Lionel's disrespect for King Edward's Chair and the Stone of Scone . After realising he has just expressed himself without impairment, Bertie is able to rehearse with Lionel and complete the ceremony. As king, Bertie has a crisis when he must broadcast to Britain and the Empire following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany in 1939. Lionel is summoned to Buckingham Palace to prepare the king for his speech.

    "plot": "The Morgans are a mining family in the South Wales Valleys during the late Victorian era . Huw, the youngest son of Gwilym Morgan, walks home with his father to meet his mother, Beth. His older brothers, Ianto, Ivor, Davy, Gwilym Jr., and Owen, all work in the coal mines with their father, while sister Angharad keeps house with their mother. Huw's childhood is idyllic; the town, not yet overrun with mining spoil , is beautiful, the household is warm and loving, and the miners sing as they walk home (in this case \" Cwm Rhondda \"). Huw is smitten with Bronwen, a girl engaged to be married to his eldest brother, Ivor. At the boisterous wedding party Angharad meets the new preacher, Mr. Gruffydd, and there is an obvious mutual attraction. Trouble begins when the mine owner decreases wages, and the miners strike in protest. Gwilym's attempt to mediate by not endorsing a strike estranges him from the other miners as well as his older sons, who leave home. Beth interrupts a late night meeting of the strikers, threatening to kill anyone who harms her husband. She and Huw head across the fields in a snowstorm in the dark to return home. On their way home the strikers hear Huw calling for help. They rescue Beth and Huw from the river. Beth has temporarily lost the use of her legs and the doctor fears that Huw, who has also lost the use of his legs, will never walk again. He eventually recovers with the help of Mr. Gruffydd, which further endears the latter to Angharad. The strike is eventually settled, and Gwilym and his sons reconcile, yet many miners have lost their jobs. The exceptionally beautiful Angharad is courted by the mine owner's son, Iestyn Evans (Marten Lamont), though she loves Mr. Gruffydd. Mr. Gruffydd loves her too, to the malicious delight of the gossipy townswomen, but cannot bear to subject her to the hard, spartan life of an impoverished minister of religion. Angharad submits to a loveless marriage to Evans, and they relocate out of the country. Huw begins school at a nearby village. Abused by other boys, he is taught to fight by boxer Dai Bando and his crony, Cyfartha. After a beating by the cruel teacher Mr. Jonas, Dai Bando avenges Huw with an impromptu boxing display on Mr. Jonas to the delight of his pupils. Bronwyn learns Ivor has been killed in a mine accident. The shock causes her to go into labor and she gives birth to a son. Later, two of Morgan's sons are dismissed in favor of less experienced, cheaper laborers. With no job prospects, they leave to seek their fortunes abroad. Huw is awarded a scholarship to university, but to his father's dismay he refuses it to work in the mines. He relocates with Bronwyn, to help provide for her and her child. When Angharad returns without her husband, vicious gossip of an impending divorce spreads through the town. It is eventually announced there will be a meeting of the Deacons – the governing council of the local Calvinistic Methodist chapel – to discuss, denounce and excommunicate Angharad. This prospect enrages Mr. Gruffydd, for he knows she has done nothing other than return home from Cape Town without her husband. After condemning the Deacons' small-mindedness, he storms out before the meeting intent on leaving the town. That evening, the alarm whistle sounds, signaling another mine disaster. Several men are injured, and Gwilym and others are trapped in a cave-in . Mr Gruffydd catches sight of Angharad, who has rushed to the mine for word of her father. As she looks pleadingly at him, he calls, \"Who is for Gwilym Morgan and the others?\" Young Huw, Mr. Gruffydd, and Dai Bando descend with other volunteers to rescue the remaining miners. Gwilym and his son are briefly re-united before he succumbs to his injuries. Above, in the cold of light dawn, the women of the family – Angharad, Bronwyn and Beth Morgan – have stood vigil all night; the sound of the pulley announces the lift is returning from the depths of the mine. Huw is cradling his father's body, his coal-blackened face devoid of youthful innocence.",

    "plot": "Thousands of years ago, five African tribes warred over a meteorite containing the metal vibranium . One warrior ingests a \"heart-shaped herb\" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first \"Black Panther\". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda . Over centuries, the Wakandans use vibranium to develop advanced technologies and isolate themselves from the world by posing as an underdeveloped country . In 1992, Wakanda king T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu , who is working undercover in Oakland, California . T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri , another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. In the present day, following T'Chaka's death, [ a ] his son T'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. He and Okoye , leader of the Dora Milaje , extract T'Challa's ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda and younger sister Shuri . At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat without the benefit of the heart-shaped herb. T'Challa defeats M'Baku when he persuades him to yield rather than die. When Klaue and his accomplice Erik Stevens steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's husband W'Kabi urges him to bring Klaue back alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan , South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross . A firefight erupts, and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa, who reluctantly releases him to Ross's custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. When Erik attacks to extract Klaue, Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. While Shuri tends to Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu, since Erik wore a necklace that belonged to him. Zuri explains that N'Jobu had become disillusioned with Wakanda's isolationism and planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent to help them overcome their oppressors, with Klaue's assistance. Before T'Chaka could apprehend N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka instructed Zuri to claim that N'Jobu had vanished and to leave behind N'Jobu's American son, N'Jadaka, to uphold the story. This boy grew up to become Erik, a U.S. black ops Navy SEAL who took on the nickname \"Killmonger.\" Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and brings his body to Wakanda. He is presented before the tribal elders, revealing himself as N'Jadaka and asserting his claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat and kills Zuri; without the powers of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa is severely injured and presumed dead after Killmonger throws him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest to be incinerated, but Nakia manages to extract one. Killmonger, backed by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives worldwide. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari as repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who also dons a nanotech suit similar to T'Challa's. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying vibranium weapons before they can leave Wakanda. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die as a free man rather than be incarcerated; T'Challa shows him the Wakanda sunset, and Killmonger dies peacefully. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene , T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his rehabilitation.",

    "plot": "Ray Kinsella lives with his wife, Annie, and daughter, Karin, on their corn farm in Dyersville, Iowa . Troubled by his broken relationship with his late father John, a devoted baseball fan, Ray fears growing old without ever having done anything to achieve his dreams. While walking through his cornfield one evening, Ray hears a voice whispering, \"If you build it, he will come\"; [ 6 ] he sees a vision of a baseball diamond in the cornfield and the ghost of \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson standing in the middle. Annie agrees to uproot part of their field to build a baseball field, at risk of financial hardship. As Ray builds the field, he tells Karin about the 1919 Black Sox Scandal . Time passes, and as Ray is beginning to doubt himself, Shoeless Joe reappears one evening. After tossing a few balls around the field, Joe asks Ray if he can come back with more players. Ray says they are all welcome. The next day, Joe returns with the seven other Black Sox players. Annie's brother, Mark, cannot see the players. He warns the couple they are going bankrupt and offers to buy their land. The voice, meanwhile, urges Ray to \"ease his pain.\" Ray and Annie attend a PTA meeting, where she argues against some who are trying to ban books by Terence Mann, a controversial author and activist from the 1960s. Ray deduces the voice was referring to Mann, who had named one of his characters \"John Kinsella\" and had once professed a childhood dream of playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers . That night, after Ray and Annie have identical dreams about Ray and Mann attending a game together at Fenway Park , Ray drives to Boston to find him. Mann, who has become a disenchanted recluse, agrees to attend one game. There Ray hears the voice urging him to \"go the distance\", while seeing statistics on the scoreboard for Archie \"Moonlight\" Graham , who played in one 1922 game for the New York Giants but never got to bat. Mann also admits to hearing the voice and seeing the scoreboard. The pair drive to Chisholm, Minnesota , and learn that Graham, who became a physician, had died years earlier. Ray researches Graham, whose obituary said he was a beloved and charitable doctor, but makes no mention of his baseball career. Ray suddenly finds himself in 1972, and meets an elderly Graham, who feels his calling in life was medicine, not sports, and declines to visit Ray's baseball field. During the drive back to Iowa, Ray and Mann pick up a young hitchhiker named Archie Graham, who is looking for a baseball team to join. Ray later tells Mann that his father dreamed of being a baseball player, then tried to make him pick up the sport instead. At 14, after reading one of Mann's books, Ray stopped playing catch with his father, and they became estranged after he mocked John, saying \"[he] could never respect a man whose hero [Joe] was a criminal.\" Ray admits that his greatest regret is that his father died before they could reconcile. As they continue the drive, Mann and Ray agree that the building of the field, and bringing Joe back, is Ray's penance for his estrangement from his father. Arriving at the farm, they see various all-star players of the 1920s have arrived, fielding a second team. A game is played and Graham finally gets his turn at bat. The next day, Mark returns, demanding that Ray sell the farm or the bank will foreclose on him. Karin insists that people will pay to watch the ballgames. Mann agrees, saying that \"people will come\" to relive their childhood innocence. Ray and Mark scuffle, accidentally knocking Karin off the bleachers. Graham – despite knowing he will be unable to return after stepping off the field – saves her from choking on a hot dog. Having become old Doc Graham again, he reassures Ray that he has no regrets. As he heads back toward the cornfield, he is commended by the other players, and before he can enter it, Shoeless Joe calls out, \"Hey, rookie!\" Graham stops and turns to Shoeless Joe, who tells him, \"You were good.\" Doc Graham's eyes shine with tears before he smiles, turns back toward the corn, and disappears into it. Suddenly, Mark too can see the players and urges Ray to keep the farm after all. Shoeless Joe invites Mann to enter the corn, and Mann happily accepts. Ray is angry at not being invited but Joe rebukes him, glancing towards the catcher at home plate , saying, \"If you build it, he will come.\" [ 6 ] When the catcher removes his mask, Ray recognizes him as his father, John, as a young man. Ray and Annie then understand that \"ease his pain\" and \"go the distance\" both refer to Ray and his father. Ray introduces John to his wife and daughter, without acknowledging him as his father. Later, as evening falls, John says goodnight to Ray and they shake hands. As John is walking towards the cornfield, Ray, addressing him as \"Dad\", asks him if he'd like to play catch. John gladly accepts, as a long line of cars is seen approaching the field, fulfilling the prophecy that people will come to the field to watch baseball.",

    "plot": "Dom Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\" who perform corporate espionage using experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets' subconscious and extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb's ability to layer multiple dreams within each other . He offers to hire Cobb for the ostensibly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person's subconscious; performing \"inception\" on Robert Fischer, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream's architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind's projection of his late wife, Mal. Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \" kick \" (using the French song \" Non, je ne regrette rien \") to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously. The team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but unknown to any team member, his subconscious projections, trained to anticipate such a scenario, attack them. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would usually awaken dreamers, Yusuf's sedatives will instead send them into \" Limbo \": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb explains to Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \"wake up,\" she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her murder to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind. Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that Browning has kidnapped him to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert to another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed. However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress, respectively, with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception; he and Saito are subsequently lost in Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert's inception and Eames's kick. Cobb reveals that during their time in Limbo, Mal refused to return to reality; Cobb had to convince her it was only a dream, accidentally incepting in her the belief that the real world was still a dream. Cobb makes peace with his part in Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, Robert discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving in Los Angeles , Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint, and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's \"totem\" – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.",

    "plot": "During his farewell address in 1961, outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower warns about the build-up of the military-industrial complex . He is succeeded by John F. Kennedy as president, whose time in office is marked by the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis until his assassination in Dealey Plaza , Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Ex-Marine and suspected Soviet defector Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and arraigned with both murders but is killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby . New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his team investigate potential New Orleans links to the JFK assassination, including private pilot and activist David Ferrie , but their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government and Garrison closes the investigation. The investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the Warren Report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies, such as the Single bullet theory . Garrison and his staff interrogate people involved with Oswald and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O'Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for solicitation , who says that he witnessed Ferrie talking with a man called \" Clay Bertrand \" about assassinating Kennedy, and that he briefly met Oswald. Garrison and his team theorize Oswald never actually \"defected\" and was in fact a double agent of the CIA who was betrayed and framed for the assassination. In 1967, Garrison and his team talk to several witnesses, including Jean Hill , a teacher who says she witnessed a gunman shooting from the \"grassy knoll\", a small hill, that Secret Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald was said to have shot Kennedy, and her testimony was altered by the Warren Commission . Garrison's staff also test fire an empty Carcano rifle from the Depository and conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, and that there was more than one shooter. Garrison comes to believe that \"Bertrand\" is really New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw . Garrison interviews Shaw, who denies having ever met Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ruby and Ferrie, die in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as \"X\", who claims Kennedy's security in Dallas was deliberately neglected. He also suggests a coup d'état at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the CIA, the Mafia , the military-industrial complex, Secret Service , FBI , and then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson as either co-conspirators or as having motives to cover up the truth of the assassination. X suggests that Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull the United States out of the Vietnam War , halt further actions against Cuba , and dismantle the CIA. X encourages Garrison to keep digging and prosecute Shaw. Soon afterward, Garrison indicts Shaw with conspiring to murder Kennedy. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality . Some of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, and leave the investigation. One of them, Bill Broussard, is later revealed to have been an insider for the FBI for some time, and even plays a peripheral, undisclosed role in what seems to be an attempt to kidnap, murder or otherwise scare Garrison. In addition, Garrison is criticized in the media as wasting taxpayer money to investigate a conspiracy theory . Garrison suspects a connection with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy . Shaw's trial takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with a dismissal of the single-bullet theory , proposing a scenario involving three assassins firing six shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and Tippit, all for the purpose of installing Johnson as president so he could escalate the war in Vietnam and enrich the defense industry. However, the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. While his prosecution has failed, Garrison wins his wife and children's respect for his determination, and so repairs his relationship with his family.",

To alleviate Doris's misgivings, Shellhammer suggests Granville Sawyer administer a \"psychological evaluation\". After doing so, Sawyer insists Kris be put in a mental institution . Meanwhile, Susan shows Kris a magazine photo of her dream house and tells him she wants it for Christmas. Kris promises to do his best. In the company cafeteria, young employee Alfred tells Kris that Sawyer convinced him that he is unstable simply because he enjoys dressing as Santa. Kris confronts Sawyer, eventually striking him on the head with an umbrella. Sawyer, outraged, takes Kris to Bellevue Hospital . Tricked into cooperating and believing Doris to be in on the deception, Kris deliberately fails his examination and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up and represents him in court. At a hearing before Judge Henry Harper, District Attorney Thomas Mara gets Kris to assert that he is Santa Claus and rests his case, asking Harper to rule that Santa does not exist. In private, Harper's political adviser, Charlie Halloran, warns him that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. Harper buys time by hearing further evidence. Fred calls Macy as a witness and gets him to admit that he believes Santa exists. Macy then fires Sawyer. Next, Fred calls Mara's own young son, who testifies that his father told him that Santa is real. Mara concedes the point, but goes on to demand that Fred prove that Kris is \"the one and only\" Santa Claus on the basis of a competent authority by the following day. Meanwhile, Susan writes Kris a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. When a New York Post Office mail sorter sees Susan's letter, addressed to Kris at the New York courthouse, he suggests delivering all of the dead letters addressed to Santa to Kris, freeing up storage space. As court resumes, Fred is informed of the mail delivery; he argues that the Post Office , a branch of the federal government, has acknowledged that Kris is the one and only Santa Claus by delivering the letters. When the judge insists on seeing the letters, postal employees empty many bags of letters on Harper's desk. Harper dismisses the case. Kris invites Fred, Doris and Susan to a Christmas Day celebration at his current residence, the Brooks' Memorial Home for the Aged. Susan loses faith in Kris when he admits he was unable to get her the house she wanted. However, after Kris offers Fred and Doris a route home that avoids traffic, Susan sees her dream house with a \"For Sale\" sign out front; Susan becomes ecstatic and runs into the house. Fred learns that Doris had encouraged Susan to have faith and suggests they get married and purchase the house. Fred and Doris then spot a cane inside that looks just like Kris's. Fred  begins to wonder if Kris really is Santa Claus.",

    "plot": "In 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American domestic worker in Jackson, Mississippi, working for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt. She raises Elizabeth’s daughter, two-year-old Mae Mobley, who is emotionally neglected. Aibileen's best friend, Minny Jackson, works for Mrs. Walters and her manipulative daughter Hillary \"Hilly\" Holbrook, who leads the women's socialite group. Elizabeth and Hilly's mutual friend Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan is an unmarried aspiring writer and recent graduate of Ole Miss , who has been rejected by Elaine Stein, an editor at Harper and Row New York City. Securing a local job writing a housekeeping column, she witnesses the city's systemic racism and the demeaning mistreatment of maids. Hilly insists on installing separate bathrooms for the maids to use, preventing them from using the \"white bathrooms\", which she wants enshrined in building code. Skeeter's mother Charlotte tells her the family maid Constantine quit, but Skeeter does not believe her. She decides to write a book of interviews with the maids to expose their experiences. Minny is soon fired by Hilly for defiantly using an indoor bathroom during a dangerous tornado. Hilly vindictively renders Minny unemployable by spreading the lie that she stole from her, forcing her teenaged daughter to quit school to work. Celia Rae Foote, a pregnant housewife ostracized by the socialites, seeks a maid for her massive house in Madison, as she cannot cook. She gratefully hires Minny without telling her husband Johnny, Hilly's former love interest. Celia suffers a miscarriage , then reveals she had a shotgun wedding , then miscarried. They discuss Hilly's envy of Celia over Johnny. Celia treats the black eye Minny's husband has given her. Aibileen and Minny let Skeeter interview them after going to a dynamic sermon. Elaine Stein tells Skeeter she needs many more maids' stories for the book, but fear of retribution prevents others from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her only son's tragic death, due to his negligent foreman after an on-the-job accident. Skeeter slow-walks a piece in the Junior League newsletter on the \"separate but equal\" bathrooms for Hilly, instead submitting an embarrassing misprint. Hilly refuses to advance money to her new maid, Yule May Davis, who needs $75 to send both her twins to Tougaloo College . When Yule May pawns a lost ring she found under a sofa, she is violently arrested after Hilly reports her. This incident and Medgar Evers ' assassination inspire more maids to share their stories. As Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear for the maids' anonymity, Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" as a form of insurance. After her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie, but reveals – after Hilly had finished two slices – she had baked her own excrement into it. Hilly sends her mother to a nursing home for laughing about it. Skeeter finally confronts Charlotte about Constantine's departure. Charlotte confesses that during a Daughters of America luncheon at her home, she fired Constantine because her daughter Rachel, arriving earlier than expected, refused to enter the house through the kitchen. Rachel subsequently moved her heartbroken mother to Chicago , where she later died. Upset by this revelation, Skeeter bursts into tears and runs out. Her article, \"The Help\", is published anonymously and read widely by black and white communities of Jackson. Skeeter shares the proceeds with the maids, who each get the equivalent of several weeks' pay, with \"more to come.\" Skeeter's boyfriend Stuart breaks up with her, realizing she wrote it. Minny subtly reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, calling her \"Two Slice Hilly\". Panicked, Hilly threatens to sue Skeeter for libel , but backs down when she realizes she would have to publicly admit to the pie story. Charlotte intervenes, ordering Hilly off the property, then mother and daughter reconcile. Johnny tells Minny he knows she has been working at their house and promises her permanent job security, so her children and she can leave her abusive husband. Aibileen's congregation honors her for her leadership in the publication. Minny and Aibileen convince Skeeter to take a New York City job offer. In revenge, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to fire Aibileen, claiming she has stolen silverware. She defends herself, Hilly storms out in tears, and Elizabeth fires her. As Aibileen bids farewell to Mae, who is crying for her, she begs Elizabeth to love her daughter, who also cries. As she is leaving, she decides to quit domestic work to become a writer.",

Taylor participates in a night ambush of a North Vietnamese Army force. Taylor is wounded during the firefight while Gardner, another new replacement is killed due to his inexperience. Taylor returns to base from the aid station and bonds with Elias and his circle of marijuana users (\"heads\"), a clique distinct from Barnes and his hard-edged followers.

One of the soldiers, former police officer Sgt. Montgomery, tells Finlay that he and his friend Floyd Bowers met Samuels at the hotel bar and went up to his apartment to find Samuels talking to Cpl.

    "plot": "On June 7, 1893 in the Colony of Natal , young lawyer Mohandas Gandhi is forcibly expelled from a whites-only train carriage in Pietermaritzburg despite possessing a valid first class ticket, subsequently campaigning for Indian equality in the Colony of Natal and the Cape Colony . Dada Abdullah, president of the Natal Indian Congress , [ 7 ] notices his campaign and invites him to a demonstration where he burns his pass. After the Second Boer War , the British colonial government then attempts to enact a law where Indians will be fingerprinted, akin to criminals. Gandhi responds with numerous peaceful demonstrations against the new law's unjust nature, and the British colonial officer and former Boer general, Jan Smuts eventually orders his arrest. Later, the British colonial government releases Gandhi and relents by granting some rights to Indians, fulfilling his short-term goal. Anglican clergyman Charles Freer Andrews joins his mission, and Vince Walker, an American journalist from the New York Times , takes special interest in him. Gandhi's work is at his ashram, where many figures associated with him include Andrews, Hermann Kallenbuch , and later Madeleine Slade , whom Gandhi names Mirabehn. Gandhi returns to India in 1915 where he is cordially invited to the Indian National Congress where at an outdoor luncheon he gets to meet its leaders: Sardar Patel , a young Jawaharlal Nehru , Maulana Azad , and Muhammad Ali Jinnah , who is advocating self rule for India, as well as Gopal Krishna Gokhale , who becomes his mentor. Jinnah supports Gandhi's involvement in politics, but opposes his unconventional approach. At a meeting of the Congress led by Jinnah, Gandhi's speech captivates the ensemble, especially Patel. Gandhi pledges allegiance to the British Empire in World War I, but simultaneously demands self rule for India. His satyagrahas at Champaran and Kheda are brutally curtailed by the British. Despite Indian involvement in World War I, the administration in India passes the Rowlatt Act in 1919, which is seen by the movement as betrayal. While a group of people listen to speeches about freedom, General Reginald Dyer orders his Gurkha soldiers to fire upon them unawares, committing the Amritsar massacre . Jinnah suggests non-cooperation for protesting against British rule, and Gandhi surprisingly agrees. Its immediate success causes the Chauri Chaura incident , where protestors kill and burn police officers in the United Provinces . Disgusted, Gandhi orders to call off the non-cooperation movement, enraging Jinnah, before he retreats to his ashram and fasts to call off the masses. In 1930, after organizing the Salt March against the British monopoly on salt in India, accompanied by Vince Walker and his associate, Gandhi is arrested and sent to prison. When he is released, Gandhi is then invited to London by Ramsay MacDonald to attend the Round Table conferences regarding future Dominion status for the Indian Empire. However, they prove fruitless and Gandhi and the other Congress leaders are imprisoned during World War II. While under house arrest, Gandhi's wife Kasturba dies, and he mourns her. Dissatisfied by the Congress and Gandhi, Jinnah resigns and returns to the Muslim League , where he begins demands for a separate state to be made out of British India for the Muslim minority .  Gandhi is upset, and in 1945, Viceroy Louis Mountbatten declares India's upcoming independence as the territory's final Governor-General. Gandhi offers Jinnah to be Prime Minister and to choose its first cabinet; Nehru agrees to it to maintain India's independence, but Jinnah declines, stating that only independence for Pakistan with him as its leader, will ensure Muslim safety, upsetting Patel, Nehru, and Azad. India and Pakistan finally gain their independence back-to-back in August 1947, and millions of people cross the borders into the two newly-formed countries, but sectarian violence occurs along the new borders between Hindus and Muslims alike. The Indian military attempts to control uprisings in Delhi and Bombay, while in Calcutta murder and violence between Hindus and Muslims rampage through the streets. Devastated, Gandhi holds a fast unto death, causing Hindus to stand down and Huseyn Suhrawardy to call upon Muslims to stop fighting. Gandhi advises a concerned Hindu man, upset about murdering a Muslim infant to avenge his son's death in the violence, to find a Muslim boy whose family had died in the violence and raise him as a faithful Muslim. While heading to afternoon prayers in New Delhi on January 30, 1948, Gandhi is shot point blank 3 times by Nathuram Godse and exclaims \"Oh, God!\" as he perishes. After his funeral, his casket is carted throughout Delhi accompanied by a mourning Nehru (now the Prime Minister of India), numerous Indian citizens, government officials from all over India, and international dignitaries. His ashes are poured into the Ganges , and he is mourned by the leaders of the Congress and the Indian independence movement as a whole.",

Williams is scheduled to go to the gallows at 7 o'clock the following morning for an anarchist-related murder of a black policeman. Esteemed newspaperman Johnson is about to quit the journalism trade and is on his way to marry his sweetheart Peggy Grant and relocate to New York City where an advertising job awaits him. Not surprisingly, his unscrupulous boss Burns does not want him to quit.  He wants Johnson to remain on his staff so he can cover the major news story for the Morning Post . Although he is an avowed anarchist, it is revealed that Williams is likely an innocent man who has been wrongly convicted of the policeman's murder due to rising anti-red sentiments in his city. Accordingly, Burns will do anything to make sure Johnson works on that angle of the story — including delaying his wedding trip. Hours before Williams' scheduled execution, while being interviewed by an Austrian alienist and reenacting the murder, Williams manages to escape custody with the help of Sheriff Pinky Hartman's gun which the inept lawman had carelessly loaned to the doctor. With the assistance of Johnson and Burns, the newspapermen hide the fleeing Williams in a rolltop desk in a room usually occupied by a bevy of newspaper reporters gathered to cover Williams' execution. Johnson's soon-to-be mother-in-law, Mrs. Grant, sees Johnson and Burns hide Williams in the desk. To silence her, Burns has some of his cronies roughly escort her out of the building. Sheriff Hartman and the mayor of the city get a missive from the governor.  It is a reprieve for Williams. However, Williams' execution would be a political boon for the two men in an upcoming election, so they refuse to accept it. Instead, they send the messenger away with a bribe and the address of a house of ill repute. Johnson's future mother-in-law eventually returns to the press room and Williams is found in the desk. The reporters all rush to call bulletins into their editors, each with widely varying and greatly exaggerated details about how the fugitive Williams was re-arrested. Johnson and Burns are about to be arrested by Sheriff Hartman for aiding a fleeing criminal and kidnapping Mrs. Grant when the messenger from the governor reappears. Saying he is happily married and his conscience cannot let him accept the bribe, he tells the reporters about the politicians' refusal to accept the governor's pardon for Williams. The politicians quickly agree to drop their charges against the reporters in exchange for them not mentioning their own wrongdoings in the newspapers. Despite offers of a promotion at the Morning Post from Burns, Johnson says he is retiring from the newspaper business to go on his wedding trip. Burns seems to accept Johnson's career decision gracefully, even giving Johnson his prized gold watch as a thank-you gift for his services as a star reporter for the Morning Post . However, moments after Johnson and Mary depart for the railroad station, Burns arranges for the police to arrest Johnson at the train's first stop on the pretense that Johnson has stolen his watch.",

Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon's young son hides the knife that killed his father before being taken to an orphanage on Blackwell's Island . Sixteen years later in 1862, Vallon's son, \"Amsterdam,\" returns to the Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who remains in control of the territory. Amsterdam is introduced to Bill but keeps his past a secret as he seeks recruitment into the gang. He learns many of his father's former lieutenants - particularly \"Happy\" Jack Mulraney, who has become a corrupt Irish policeman on Bill's payroll, and McGloin - are now in Bill's employ, despite his deep anti-Irish views. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits and Amsterdam secretly plans to kill him publicly during this celebration. Amsterdam soon becomes attracted to pickpocket and grifter Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is also infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and becomes his protégé , involving him in the dealings of corrupt Tammany Hall politician William M. Tweed . Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion. On the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny's affection for Amsterdam, reveals Amsterdam's true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a knife throwing act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill then beats him and burns his cheek with a hot blade before banishing him, believing Amsterdam to not be worthy of death. Going into hiding, Jenny implores him to escape with her to San Francisco . Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square in front of several Irish gangs that were allied with the Dead Rabbits. Bill sends corrupt Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam garrotes him to death and hangs his body in the square. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. When Amsterdam's gang beats McGloin, Bill and the Natives march on the church and are met by Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits, with new and former members filling its ranks. No violence ensues, but Bill promises to return soon. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Amsterdam presents Tweed with a plan to defeat Bill's influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for sheriff and Amsterdam will secure the Irish vote for Tammany. Monk wins in a landslide , and a humiliated Bill murders him with his own club . McGinn's death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square, which Bill accepts. The Civil War draft riots break out as the gangs are preparing to fight, and Union army soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs prepare to fight, cannon fire from ships hits Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Many of the gang members are killed by the naval gunfire, soldiers, or rioters. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another amidst the chaos until Bill is wounded by shrapnel. Finally, Amsterdam uses his father's knife to kill Bill. Bill passes away holding hands with Amsterdam. Amsterdam buries the knife next to his father in a cemetery in Brooklyn , erecting a makeshift headstone with the name William Cutting over it now alongside the actual tombstone of Priest Vallon.

The opposition receive an anonymous tip about a threat to the deputy's life and report it to government officials, but they dismiss the claims. During the speech, Pirou, another deputy, goes to find their promised protection, but is mistaken for the real target and savagely beaten before his assailants realize they have the wrong man. As the intended target crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him, and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The Chief Prosecutor is informed of the incident and the General (head of the state police and a fierce anticommunist) lies that the deputy has been injured by a drunk driver, Yago, who they have in custody. The phone then rings, revealing the deputy has died. At the hospital, the magistrate assigned to the investigation learns that the autopsy indicates the deputy died from blows to the head, not a car crash. He is informed of a witness, but before he can testify, the man is hit by a club from a passing car. The General and the man's family, who are sympathetic to the government, visit the man in the hospital and pressure him not to testify, but he does anyway, saying that Yago (his delivery driver) talked openly about the plan to murder the Deputy. The journalist visits the man and unwittingly spoils an assassination attempt by the Deputy's assailant Vago, who has been placed in the hospital by the government and is arrested. During the interrogation, the magistrate baits Vago into revealing that he is part of a clandestine anti-communist group, the Christian Royalist Organization against Communism (CROC), with ties to the state police. With the help of a CROC informer, the journalist learns more about the organization and photographs members that the informer points out. He then takes the photos to Pirou, who identifies his assailant. It is later revealed that the Colonel bribed Pirou's assailant with a lifetime peddling license and new house to assist in their plan against the deputy. As the magistrate continues to investigate CROC, he demands that the opposition counselor produce the witness who originally told them of the plot against the deputy, revealed to be a fellow deliveryman with ties to the former Greek communist resistance movement. He describes Yago threatening him into silence, and that he saw Yago with the Colonel and the head of CROC. As one of the other opposition lawyers heads to the office to testify, a car attempts to run him down in front of a crowd of witnesses. With a large amount of corroborating evidence, the magistrate plans to charge high-ranking military officers and, upon learning of this plan, the country's attorney general arrives and criticizes his plans, arguing that they will harm the nation. He suggests that the magistrate try Yago and Vago apart, leave the issue of the police to be solved internally, and indict the opposition for inflammatory speech, but he follows through with his plans. The General denies any affiliation with CROC, but the magistrate presents a photo of a banquet he hosted in their honor. The action of the film concludes with one of the deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments, to which she looks distressed. An epilogue provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the deputy's close associates die or are deported and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents.

After their capture, the men are humiliated at a celebratory woodland banquet, with Marian given a seat of honor. Initially scornful, she comes to share Robin's views after he shows her examples of Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their lives being spared. Having noted Robin's focus on Marian during the Sherwood banquet, the sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament, with the Lady Marian presenting a golden arrow as the prize to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his archery skill, and is captured and sentenced to be hanged. Marian aids Robin's Men in a scheme to save him. After his daring escape, he scales the palace walls to thank her, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin's marriage proposal, electing to instead remain in the castle as a spy. King Richard returns with several of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard's disguise and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin's title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. He intercepts Dickon and kills him after a fight. Richard and his men, disguised as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the king's business, Richard accepts Robin's offer of hospitality and his condemnation of the Holy Crusade, but does not reveal his identity. Much relays Bess' news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now certain of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. Robin coerces the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter Nottingham Castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin kills Gisbourne after a lengthy duel, frees Marian, and prompts John's men to surrender. Returned to his throne, Richard banishes John, the Sheriff, and the Bishop from England \"for the remainder of my lifetime.\" He restores Robin's rank, raising him to Baron of Locksley and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The king also pardons Robin's men, and commands Robin to take the hand of the Lady Marian in marriage. As Robin exits the castle with her, he responds \"May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire.\"",

Louise has been led to believe her mother is a society matron named Mrs. E. Worthington Manville who lives at the Hotel Marberry. Annie discovers her charade is in danger of being uncovered when she learns Louise is sailing to New York with her fiancé Carlos ( Barry Norton ) and his father, Count Romero ( Walter Connolly ). Among Annie's patrons are Dave the Dude ( Warren William ), a gambling gangster who believes her apples bring him good luck, and his henchman Happy McGuire ( Ned Sparks ). Annie's friends from the street ask Dave to rent her an apartment at the Marberry and, although he initially declines, he has a change of heart and arranges for her to live in the lap of luxury in a palatial residence belonging to a friend. His girlfriend, nightclub owner Missouri Martin ( Glenda Farrell ), helps transform Annie from a dowdy street peddler to an elegant dowager. Dave arranges for erudite pool hustler Henry D. Blake ( Guy Kibbee ) to pose as Annie's second husband, the dignified Judge Manville. At the pier, an elegantly dressed Annie tearfully reunites with Louise. A group of Annie's friends from the streets are watching from a distance. One of the street people says that she can remember when Annie “always looked like that.” (We never know the details of Annie's history, but her upper-crust origins are clear.) When three society reporters become suspicious about Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, of whom they can find no public records, they are kidnapped by members of Dave's gang, and their prolonged disappearance leads the local newspapers to accuse the police department of incompetence. A few days later, Blake – in the role of Judge Manville – announces he is planning a gala reception for Louise, Carlos, and Count Romero before they return to Spain, and he enlists Dave's guys and Missouri's dolls to pose as Annie's society friends. On the night of the reception, the police – certain Dave is responsible for the missing reporters – surround Missouri's club, where the gang has assembled for a final rehearsal. Dave calls Blake to advise him of their predicament, and Annie decides to confess everything to Count Romero. But fate – in the form of a sympathetic mayor and governor and their entourages – unexpectedly steps in and allows Annie to maintain her charade and keep Louise from learning the truth before she sails back to Spain with her husband-to-be.",

    "plot": "On Thursday, alcoholic New York writer Don Birnam is packing for a weekend vacation with his brother Wick. Although they are leaving mid-afternoon, when Don's girlfriend Helen drops by with gifts for him and two tickets for a concert that afternoon, Don suggests that Wick attends with her; the brothers can then catch a later train. His motive is self-serving: he has a bottle hanging by a rope outside the window and wants to retrieve it and secure it in his suitcase. Wick eventually discovers the bottle. Don claims to have forgotten it was there; Wick pours it down the drain. Now, knowing that all the liquor Don had hidden in the apartment has been disposed of, and believing that he has no money for more, Helen and Wick go to the concert. After finding ten dollars Wick left for the cleaning lady, Don heads for Nat's Bar, calling in at a liquor store on the way to purchase two bottles of rye . He intends to be back home in time to meet Wick and catch their train but his drinking makes him lose track of time. Arriving home, he sees Wick and Helen on the street and, concealing himself, overhears Wick say that he has given up on helping Don and is leaving, scolding Helen for deciding to stay and wait for Don. Don sneaks back into the apartment and hides a bottle while drinking the other one. On Friday, at Nat's Bar, Don learns that Helen came in looking for him the previous night. Don says that he intends to write a novel about his battle with alcoholism, called The Bottle . In a flashback, he recalls how he first met Helen at the opera house. The cloakroom has mixed up their coats. Subsequently, the two strike up a romance, and he remains sober during this time. While going to meet her parents, he overhears them talking about his unemployment and how they are not certain if he is good enough for Helen. He loses his nerve and sneaks off, after phoning Helen from a booth and making a phony excuse, ostensibly intending to meet her parents later. However, he returns home and gets drunk. She goes to his apartment, where Wick tries to cover for him, but Don confesses that he is two people: \"Don the writer\", whose fear of failure causes him to drink, and \"Don the drunk\", who always has to be bailed out by Wick. Helen devotes herself to helping him. After telling Nat the story behind his proposed novel, Don heads back home to begin writing it. However, his alcohol cravings get the better of him and he begins a search for that second bottle from the previous night. He cannot remember where he hid it. He goes to a nightclub, realizes that he cannot pay the bill and steals money from a woman's purse. He is caught, thrown out, and told never to return. Once home, he finds the hidden bottle by chance and drinks himself into a stupor. On Saturday, Don is broke and feeling sick. He decides to pawn his typewriter so he can buy more alcohol, although he dreads the walk to the shop because he feels so ill. He discovers  the pawnshops are closed for Yom Kippur . Desperate for money, he visits Gloria, a prostitute who has a crush on him. She gives him some money, but he falls down her stairs and is knocked unconscious. On Sunday, Don wakes up in an alcoholics' ward at Bellevue Hospital , where a nurse, Bim Nolan, mocks him and other guests at \"Hangover Plaza\".  Bim offers to help offset his sure-to-come delirium tremens , but Don rejects the assistance and escapes while the staff is occupied with a raving, violent patient. On Monday, Don steals a bottle of whiskey from a store after threatening the owner and spends the day drinking. Suffering from delirium tremens, he hallucinates a nightmarish scene in which a bat flies in through his window and kills a mouse, spilling its blood. His screams alert the tenant, who contacts Helen, who immediately goes over. Finding Don collapsed and in a delirious state, she assists him to clean up and get to bed; she stays overnight on his couch. On Tuesday morning, Don slips out and pawns Helen's coat, the one that had brought them together. She trails him to the pawn shop and learns from the pawnbroker that Don traded the coat for his gun, for which he has bullets at home. She races back to Don's apartment and interrupts him just as he is about to shoot himself. She pleads with him, even going so far as to beg him to drink the last portion of whisky left in the bottle he had stolen and which she had concealed.  She declares she would rather he be alive as an alcoholic. He refuses and, while they are arguing, Nat arrives to return Don's typewriter. After Nat leaves, Helen finally convinces him that \"Don the writer\" and \"Don the drunk\" are the same person. He commits to writing his novel The Bottle , dedicated to her, which will recount the events of the weekend. As evidence of his resolve, he drops a cigarette into the glass of whisky to make it undrinkable.",

The two return to their hideout at Hole-in-the-Wall to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Cassidy's long absences, have selected Harvey Logan as their new leader. Logan challenges Cassidy to a knife fight over the gang's leadership. Cassidy defeats him using trickery, but embraces Logan's idea to rob a Union Pacific train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and thus reap more money than the first. The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Cassidy visits a favorite brothel in a nearby town, where the town marshal unsuccessfully attempts to organize a posse to track down the gang, only to have his address to the townsfolk hijacked by a friendly bicycle salesman. Sundance, meanwhile, visits his lover, schoolteacher Etta Place . Cassidy joins up with them the next morning, and takes Place for a ride on his new bike. On the second train robbery, Cassidy uses too much dynamite to blow open the safe . The explosion demolishes the baggage car in the process and the money flies everywhere. As the gang scrambles to gather it, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen. The crack squad pursues Cassidy and Sundance, who try to hide out in the brothel, and then to seek amnesty from Sheriff Bledsoe, to no avail. The posse remains in pursuit, and it includes renowned Indian tracker \"Lord Baltimore\" and lawman Joe Lefors , recognizable by his white skimmer . Cassidy and Sundance elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Place that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head E. H. Harriman to remain on their trail until they are both killed. Cassidy convinces Sundance and Place that the three should go to Bolivia , which he envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Cassidy remains optimistic. However, they know too little Spanish to pull off a bank robbery, so Place attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as Los Bandidos Yanquis . However, their confidence drops after seeing a man wearing a white skimmer and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them. Cassidy suggests \"going straight,\" and he and Sundance land their first honest job as payroll guards for a mining company. They are ambushed, though, by local bandits on their first run, and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. They kill the bandits, the first time Cassidy has ever shot someone. The duo concludes the straight life is not for them. Sensing they will be killed should they return to robbery, Place decides to return to the United States. Cassidy and Sundance steal a payroll and the burro used to carry it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the burro's brand and alerts the police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. Cassidy makes a desperate run to the burro to get ammunition, while Sundance provides covering fire. Wounded, the two take cover inside a building. Cassidy suggests their next destination should be Australia . Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two men, the local police have called on the Bolivian Army . The pair charges out of the building, guns blazing, into a hail of bullets from the massed troops, who have occupied all the surrounding vantage points.

Sixty-six embassy staff are taken hostage, but six avoid capture and are secretly sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor . The U.S. State Department explores options for exfiltrating them from Iran and consults Tony Mendez , a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist. He criticizes their proposals but offers no alternative until inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes . The cover story he crafts for the escapees requires them to pose as Canadian filmmakers scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film in Iran. On the advice of John Chambers , a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA, Mendez works with film producer Lester Siegel to create a phony film production company. They successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo , a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of Star Wars , to lend the cover story credibility. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and realize some personnel are unaccounted for. Posing as a producer for Argo , Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees, who are growing restless. He provides them Canadian passports and fake identities. They reluctantly go along, knowing that Mendez is also risking his own life. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when a hostile shopkeeper harasses them, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd. Mendez is told the operation has been canceled in favor of a planned military rescue of the hostages . He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss, Deputy Director Jack O'Donnell, to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and rebook their canceled tickets on a Swissair flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' new ticket reservations are belatedly confirmed, and the head guard's call to the fake Hollywood production company is answered only at the last second. The escapees board the plane as airport authorities are alerted to the ruse, but fail to stop the plane from taking off. U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed to protect the remaining hostages from retaliation, and full credit is given to the Canadian government. Taylor shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife while their Iranian housekeeper escapes to Iraq . Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star , secretly due to the mission's classified nature, and returns to his wife and son in Virginia . A textual epilogue reveals that the remaining hostages were released after 444 days in captivity; Chambers, who received the Intelligence Medal of Merit, remained friends with Mendez until his death; and Mendez, whose Intelligence Star was returned to him after Bill Clinton declassified the Canadian Caper in 1997, lives with his family in rural Maryland.",

Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her. Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee, and eventually begins an affair with her.  Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.  Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick, who is much older.  She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.  She leaves Frederick after admitting to having a dalliance with Elliot.  For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.  Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else. Hannah's ex-husband Mickey, a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.  Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.  However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.  He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly, when they were set up after the divorce.  A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.  When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.  His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness .  Ultimately, a suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers ' Duck Soup in a movie theater.  The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love. Holly's story is the film's third main arc.  A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.  After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April, a friend and fellow actress.  Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect, David.  Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with David fails and decides to try her hand at writing.  The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.  She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.  It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).  Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.  Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date. A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma and Evan.  They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.  Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings. By the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married a literature professor she met while taking random classes at Columbia University . Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.

The two marry and return to the Benedict family's expansive cattle ranch, Reata, in Texas. Upon arrival, Leslie clashes with Bick’s strong-willed sister, Luz, who resents her presence and maintains control over the household. Leslie gradually discovers the deeply rooted patriarchal norms and racial hierarchies in Texas society, particularly the systemic discrimination against the region’s Hispanic population. During a tour of the ranch with Jett Rink, a ranch hand infatuated with Leslie, she observes the harsh living conditions of the Hispanic workers and urges Bick to improve their circumstances. Her efforts include arranging medical care for Angel Obregón Jr., the infant son of one of the workers, though Bick is initially reluctant to allow their family doctor to treat non-white patients. Luz is killed after being thrown from Leslie’s horse, War Winds. In her will, she bequeaths a small parcel of land to Jett, angering Bick. Jett declines Bick’s offer to purchase the property and names it \"Little Reata.\" Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III (\"Jordy\") and Judy, followed by a daughter, Luz II. Marital tensions lead Leslie to take the children to her parents in Maryland for an extended stay. Bick follows, and the couple reconciles and returns to Texas. Meanwhile, Jett works his land and eventually strikes oil. With his newfound wealth, he attempts to persuade Bick to permit oil drilling on Reata, but Bick refuses, determined to preserve the ranch’s cattle legacy. By 1941, the Benedict children have grown, and new tensions emerge. Bick expects Jordy to take over the ranch, but Jordy wishes to become a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend finishing school in Switzerland, though Judy aspires to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech . Each child successfully convinces one parent to support their goals. At the family’s Christmas gathering shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor , Bick offers Judy’s husband, Bob Dace, a postwar position on the ranch, which he declines in favor of building an independent life with Judy. Realizing his children are unlikely to continue the family ranching tradition, Bick finally agrees to allow oil drilling on Reata. The family grows wealthier, but Angel Obregón Jr. is killed in the war. Jordy later marries Juana, the daughter of the Hispanic doctor who had treated Angel as a child. Jett, now a powerful oilman, hosts a lavish event at his Austin hotel and invites the Benedicts. A flirtation between Jett and Luz II ends after she rejects his awkward marriage proposal.

    "obfuscated_plot": "In the mid-1920s, a wealthy rancher from a southern state travels to an eastern state to purchase a horse and meets a socialite. The two marry and return to the family's expansive cattle ranch. Upon arrival, the wife clashes with her husband's strong-willed sister, who resents her presence and maintains control over the household. The wife gradually discovers the deeply rooted patriarchal norms and racial hierarchies in the regional society, particularly the systemic discrimination against the local Hispanic population. During a tour of the ranch with a ranch hand infatuated with her, she observes the harsh living conditions of the Hispanic workers and urges her husband to improve their circumstances. Her efforts include arranging medical care for a worker's infant son, though her husband is initially reluctant to allow their family doctor to treat non-white patients.\n\nThe husband's sister is killed after being thrown from the wife's horse. In her will, she bequeaths a small parcel of land to the ranch hand, angering her brother. The ranch hand declines the husband's offer to purchase the property and names it after himself. The couple has three children. Marital tensions lead the wife to take the children to her parents for an extended stay. The husband follows, and the couple reconciles and returns home.\n\nMeanwhile, the ranch hand works his land and eventually strikes oil. With his newfound wealth, he attempts to persuade the husband to permit oil drilling on the ranch, but the husband refuses, determined to preserve the cattle legacy. By the early 1940s, the children have grown, and new tensions emerge. The father expects his son to take over the ranch, but the son wishes to become a doctor. The mother wants her daughter to attend finishing school, though the daughter aspires to study animal husbandry. Each child successfully convinces one parent to support their goals.\n\nAt a family gathering shortly after a major wartime attack, the father offers his daughter's husband a postwar position on the ranch, which he declines in favor of building an independent life. Realizing his children are unlikely to continue the family ranching tradition, the father finally agrees to allow oil drilling on the ranch. The family grows wealthier, but a worker's son is killed in the war. The son later marries a Hispanic woman, the daughter of the doctor who had treated the worker's son as a child.\n\nThe ranch hand, now a powerful oilman, hosts a lavish event at his hotel and invites the family. A flirtation between the ranch hand and the daughter ends after she rejects his awkward marriage proposal. The ranch hand becomes intoxicated and orders that Hispanics not be served at his hotel, resulting in his son-in-law's wife being ignored at the beauty salon. When confronted, the ranch hand assaults and removes the son-in-law. The father challenges the ranch hand but, recognizing his inebriated state, refrains from physical retaliation. The ranch hand collapses during an attempt to deliver a speech.\n\nThe next day, while driving home, the family stops at a diner where the owner insults the son-in-law's wife and child.

    "plot": "In a nursing home , elderly Irish-American World War II veteran Frank Sheeran recounts his time as a hitman for the Italian-American Mafia . In 1950s Philadelphia , Sheeran works as a union delivery truck driver, where he starts selling some of the meat shipments to a local Philadelphia Italian-American gangster known as \"Skinny Razor,\" a member of the Philadelphia crime family headed by Angelo Bruno . After the delivery company accuses Sheeran of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino gets the case dismissed when Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino , head of his namesake crime family in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for him, as well as members of the South Philadelphia underworld, including \"painting houses,\" a euphemism for contract killing. Sheeran is soon introduced to Jimmy Hoffa , head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. He is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano , in addition to mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy; in turn Sheeran becomes his chief bodyguard . After the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy , Bufalino is thrilled while Hoffa is furious. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy , whom he appointed Attorney General , forms a \"Get Hoffa\" squad to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for jury tampering . While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement as Teamsters president, Frank \"Fitz\" Fitzsimmons , misuses the union's pension fund and gives interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion , also deteriorates beyond repair when Hoffa refuses to help restore his forfeited pension. Hoffa's sentence is commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980. Despite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. His growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and his intention to separate the union from the Mafia begin to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell pleads with Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he \"knows things\" that Russell and the dons of other families are unaware of and claims that what he knows makes him untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison. In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell reluctantly informs Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell further informs Sheeran that he must serve as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to a private airport where Sheeran boards a plane to Detroit . Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local restaurant with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone , is surprised to see Sheeran arriving late, with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and loan shark Sally Bugs . They tell Hoffa the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting, so Sheeran is to drive him over there. Entering the house, Hoffa realizes it is empty and that he has been set up. He turns around to leave, at which point Sheeran shoots him dead at point-blank range and leaves the gun on his body by the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two other mobsters wrap up the body and cremate it in secret. Invoking their Fifth Amendment rights in a grand jury investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are eventually convicted and incarcerated on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder; all but Sheeran die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters. Peggy, however, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance, has since severed all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a Catholic priest assigned to the nursing home, who assures him an overall absolution for whatever crimes committed or denied over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's safety habits.",

    "plot": "On a hot summer day in the New York County Courthouse , the trial has just concluded of an 18-year-old boy, characterized as a \"slum kid\", who is accused of killing his abusive father. The judge instructs the jury that if there is reasonable doubt , they must return a verdict of \"not guilty.\" If found guilty, the defendant will receive a mandatory death sentence via the electric chair . The verdict must be unanimous. At first, the case seems clear. A neighbor who lives opposite testifies to having seen the defendant stab his father, as she lay in bed looking out of her window and through the windows of a passing elevated train into the apartment where the killing took place. A disabled neighbor living below testifies that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father, then heard the body hitting the floor. He says that on going to his door and opening it, he saw the defendant running down the stairs. The defendant had recently purchased, but claimed that he had lost, a switchblade of the same type that was found at the murder scene, wiped of fingerprints. In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who believes there is reasonable doubt and wants discussion before any verdict. When his first few arguments—including proving that the knife, believed to be unique, is in fact not—fail to convince the other jurors, he suggests a secret ballot. This reveals one other \"not guilty\" vote; Juror 9 reveals that he, too, now agrees there should be more discussion. Juror 8 argues that the noise of the passing train would have obscured everything the second witness claimed to have overheard. Several jurors question whether the death threat, even if it was overheard, was simply a figure of speech. Two jurors change their votes. After looking at a diagram of the second witness's apartment, and conducting an experiment, the jurors determine that it is impossible for the disabled witness to have made it to the door in the time he stated. Juror 3, infuriated, lunges at Juror 8 and threatens to kill him; all go silent as they realize his words cannot reasonably be taken literally. Two more change their votes; the jury is now evenly split. The father's stab wound was angled downwards. Juror 5, who has had personal experience with switchblades, points out that such blades are designed to be thrust upwardly, and that a downward thrust from a shorter, experienced assailant is inconceivable as it would have required the blade to have been repositioned in the killer's hand. After another vote, the jurors are split 9:3. Juror 10 delivers a prejudiced rant against people from slum backgrounds, resulting in most of the other jurors distancing themselves from him. Juror 4 declares that the evidence from the woman who saw the killing from her bed is solid, convincing one juror to revert back to guilty. After watching Juror 4 remove his glasses and rub the impressions they made on his nose, Juror 9 realizes that the witness was constantly rubbing similar marks on her own nose, showing that she was a regular glasses-wearer despite not wearing them in court. Juror 8 remarks that the witness's evidence must be questionable as she said she was in bed trying to sleep at the time, when she would not have been wearing her glasses, nor would she have had time to put them on.

At first, Daisy refuses to let anyone drive her, but Hoke's patience pays off, and she reluctantly accepts the first two trips; one to the Piggly Wiggly supermarket, the other to her synagogue . Then she tries to get Boolie to fire Hoke after she had discovered a can of salmon missing from her pantry which she believes Hoke had stolen the previous day. However, the following morning when arriving for work, and without knowing that Miss Daisy had even noticed the missing can, Hoke tells her that he has brought a replacement can because he had eaten the salmon himself the previous evening because the leftovers she had provided for his dinner were inedible. As Daisy and Hoke spend time together, she comes to appreciate his many skills.  She teaches him to read using her teaching skills and resources. After Idella dies in the spring of 1963, rather than hire a new housekeeper, Daisy decides to care for her own house and have Hoke do the cooking and the driving. Meanwhile, Hoke buys the cars in which he drives Miss Daisy, after they are traded in for newer models, and he negotiates a higher salary with Boolie. The film explores racism against African Americans and antisemitism in the South. After her synagogue is bombed , Daisy realizes that she is also a victim of prejudice. American society is undergoing radical changes, and Miss Daisy attends a dinner at which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gives a speech. Boolie declines when she invites him to the dinner, and suggests that she invite Hoke. She waits until the last moment, and even then only raises it with Hoke in the car on the way to the event, saying that Boolie had said that Hoke wanted to attend. Hoke says he had said no such thing, and tells Miss Daisy that she should have just asked him directly if she had thought he might like to attend. She attends the dinner alone while Hoke listens to the speech on the car radio. She is struck by King's words in his speech, when he says that \"the greatest tragedy was not the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people.\" One morning in 1971, Hoke arrives at the house to find Daisy agitated and showing signs of dementia : she believes that she is a young teacher again. Hoke calms her down. In that conversation, she calls Hoke her \"best friend\". Boolie arranges for Daisy to enter a retirement home. In 1973, Hoke, now 85 and rapidly losing his eyesight, retires. Boolie, now 65, drives Hoke to the retirement home to visit Daisy, now 97. [ 7 ] The two catch up, and Hoke gently feeds her Thanksgiving pie. The final scene is an image of the black Cadillac driving on a road.",

In 1911, Daniel is approached by Paul Sunday, a young man who tells him of an oil deposit in Little Boston. Daniel visits the Sundays' property in Little Boston and meets Paul's twin brother Eli, a preacher.

Georges is a Romanian-born gigolo who has arrived in a Mexican border town seeking entry to the US. He has to endure a waiting period of up to eight years in order to obtain a quota number , living with other hopeful immigrants in the Esperanza Hotel. After six months he is broke and unhappy. When he runs into his former dancing partner, Anita Dixon, she explains how she quickly obtained US citizenship by marrying an American, who she then, just as quickly, divorced. Georges resolves on the same plan. He soon targets visiting school teacher Miss Emmy Brown who is in Mexico on a day trip with her class of about fifteen young boys. Georges manages to extend the time necessary to repair her broken-down automobile. Emmy and her pupils sleep in the lobby of the full-up Esperanza Hotel. This provides Georges the opportunity to quickly and intensively woo Emmy in the early morning hours; she awakens to him sitting nearby and gazing at her lovingly. By claiming she is the exact image of the lost love of his life, his seemingly intense ardor toward a stranger is plausible, and they marry later that same day. However, Georges must wait some weeks before entering the US, and Emmy returns home with the boys. A few days later, Emmy unexpectedly returns, complicating Georges' plans. Immigration inspector Hammock also appears, hunting for con artists such as Georges, and necessitating Georges' and an unwitting Emmy's departure. He drives all night, arriving at dawn in a small village. They participate in a festival of traditional blessings for newlyweds, an event that Emmy assumes has been Georges' destination all along. Georges had not planned on consummating the marriage, believing that he could return her to her small town essentially unchanged by the marriage, and fakes a shoulder injury. However, as the trip continues, he is surprised and increasingly enchanted by Emmy. When they stop at the seaside, Emmy bathes in the cool green water and Georges is unable to resist making love to her. However, this jeopardizes Anita's plan for her and Georges to meet in New York and work together, to which he had agreed. Anita has long been in love with Georges, and on their return, brutally informs Emmy of the entire scheme reciting the inscription on Emmy's wedding ring, which Georges' said was his mother's. Hammock then asks Emmy to verify the legitimacy of her marriage; she does not turn him in, partially blaming her own naiveté, but nevertheless leaves him. Returning to the US, she drives distractedly, in anguish at Georges' betrayal. When a black lace veil Georges had bought her is blown into her face, she is seriously injured in a car accident. When Georges learns of this, he immediately crosses the border, jeopardizing his visa to go to her. On hearing his voice, she awakens; seeing him, her misery is relieved and her breathing and heartbeat normalize as he sits with her for hours. However, Hammock is still on his tail, and, when Georges sees police arriving, he takes off. He heads to Paramount to try to sell his story to director Dwight Saxon, in order to get the money for Emmy's care. Hammock catches up with him and returns him to Mexico. Some weeks later, Hammock returns to the border town. Anita has a new sugar daddy. Georges has unsurprisingly not heard from Emmy, and believes the worst, sitting dejectedly on a bench writing notes in the sand. Hammock joins him, and tells Georges that he didn't report the illegal entry – Georges' visa has been approved.

Hill discovers that River City is the home of his former associate Marcellus Washburn; with Marcellus's help, Hill incites a moral panic among River City's parents that their boys are being seduced into sin by the town's new pool table. He suggests that a marching band will keep young boys out of trouble. Anticipating that Marian Paroo, the town's librarian and piano teacher, is suspicious of his motives, Hill sets out to seduce her. Also suspicious is Mayor Shinn, owner of the billiard parlor , who orders the school board to obtain Hill's credentials. When they attempt to do so, Hill distracts them by teaching them to sing as a barbershop quartet . Thereafter, Hill tricks them into breaking into four-part harmony whenever they ask for his credentials. Hill's wooing of Marian, who mistrusts him, has little effect, though he succeeds in winning the admiration of her mother and befriends her unhappy younger brother, Winthrop. When Marian discovers that Hill's claim to being a graduate of Gary Conservatory is a lie, she attempts to expose him, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Wells Fargo wagon, delivering the band instruments that the townspeople had ordered. When Winthrop, after years of moody withdrawal, joins in the townspeople's singing and speaks effusively about his new cornet , which had arrived in the wagon, Marian changes her mind about Hill. Hill tells the boys to learn to play via the Think System, in which they simply have to think of a tune over and over and will know how to play it without ever practicing on their instruments. Meeting Marian at the traditional footbridge—the first time she has ever been there with a man—Hill learns that she knows of his deception but did not tell because she is in love with him. He is about to leave town when Charlie Cowell, a disgruntled anvil salesman who was run out of Brighton, Illinois , because Hill had conned the townspeople there, comes to River City and exposes Hill. Sought by an angry mob and pressed to leave town by Marcellus and Marian, Hill realizes he is in love with Marian and does not want to leave. Hill is captured by the mob and brought before a town meeting to be tarred and feathered. Marian defends Hill; the townspeople, reminded of how he has brought so many of them together, relent.

When the young brother, after years of moody withdrawal, joins in the townspeople's singing and speaks effusively about his new cornet, the librarian changes her mind about the con man. He tells the boys to learn to play via the Think System, in which they simply have to think of a tune over and over and will know how to play it without ever practicing on their instruments. Meeting the librarian at a traditional footbridge—the first time she has ever been there with a man—he learns that she knows of his deception but did not tell because she is in love with him. He is about to leave town when another salesman comes and exposes him. Sought by an angry mob and pressed to leave town by his associate and the librarian, he realizes he is in love with her and does not want to leave. He is captured by the mob and brought before a town meeting to be tarred and feathered. The librarian defends him; the townspeople, reminded of how he has brought so many of them together, relent. The mayor reminds the townspeople how much money he has taken with no apparent result. When he demands to know \"Where's the band?\" the con man is saved by the town's boys, who play a classical piece. Although their technique is awful, the parents are enthralled. As the boys march out of the town hall, they are suddenly transformed in the townspeople's imagination into a band, playing and marching with perfection, led by the con man."

Farrokh offers himself as a replacement singer and impresses them with his vocal ability. Farrokh seeks out Mary at Biba and they start dating. The band plays gigs across Britain with Farrokh as the lead singer and new bassist John Deacon . Farrokh pushes them to think bigger and sells their van to finance a record album. An A&R rep from EMI asks engineer Roy Thomas Baker for demos. Farrokh changes his name to Freddie Mercury and renames the band Queen. They sign with John Reid , who books an American tour. Paul Prenter , who is attracted to Freddie, manages their daily schedule. An appearance on Top of the Pops gives Queen their first hit, \" Killer Queen \". Freddie proposes to Mary but, while on tour, he begins questioning his sexuality. In 1975, Queen record their fourth studio album, A Night at the Opera , placing extensive effort into recording Freddie's magnum opus, \" Bohemian Rhapsody \". However, they quit EMI when executive Ray Foster refuses to release it as the album's lead single. Freddie conspires with radio DJ Kenny Everett to debut the song on his programme. Despite critical pans, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" becomes a global hit, launching Queen to international superstardom. Following a world tour, Freddie begins an affair with Paul and comes out to Mary as bisexual. She counters that he is gay and they call off the engagement but remain close friends. The band's success continues into the early 1980s with hits such as \" We Will Rock You \", and \" Another One Bites the Dust \", but tensions arise over Paul's influence on Freddie. At a lavish party at his home, Freddie is attracted to a waiter, Jim Hutton, who tells Freddie to find him when he learns self-acceptance. Paul encourages Reid to persuade Freddie to go solo, but when the idea offends Freddie, Paul feigns ignorance and Freddie fires Reid without consulting the band, increasing their strain. Jim \"Miami\" Beach , the band's lawyer, takes over management. During a 1982 press conference for the band's album Hot Space , the press bombards Freddie with questions about his health and sexuality. Freddie's relationship with the band further deteriorates after the campy music video for \" I Want to Break Free \", where the band appears in drag, backfires and he signs a $4-million solo deal with CBS Records , effectively breaking up the band. He records his 1984 solo album Mr. Bad Guy in Munich and engages in drugs and gay orgies with Paul, but starts to feel unwell. Mary, now married and pregnant, visits unexpectedly and urges him to return to Queen and participate in the benefit concert Live Aid . Realizing that Paul withheld news of Live Aid from him and has been a corrosive influence, Freddie fires him. In retaliation, Paul goes public about Freddie's sexual escapades. Freddie returns to London and, with Miami's help, reconciles with the band persuades them to play at Live Aid as a last-minute addition. He learns that he has AIDS and reveals his condition to the band, but brushes off their sympathy, and requests that it be kept concealed from the public, wishing to perform and make music for however long he has left. The band embraces in solidarity. On the day of Live Aid, Freddie reconnects with Jim Hutton, Mary, and his family, and heeds his father's Zoroastrian maxim, \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds\". Freddie and the band are in top form at Live Aid, performing several hits including \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \" Radio Ga Ga \", and \" We Are the Champions \", and helping to increase donations. Intertitles reveal that Freddie died from AIDS-related pneumonia in 1991; He was cremated in the tradition of his family's Zoroastrian faith, which led to the establishment of the Mercury Phoenix Trust by the remaining band members and Miami the following year, and the re-release of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" two weeks after his passing, reaching #1 again in the UK and #2 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100 .",

He intends to buy a 12-block radius around a competitor's factory to force him out of business, but one household refuses to sell. Kirby instructs his real-estate broker, John Blakely, to offer the household a huge sum, and if they still refuse, to cause trouble for the family. Kirby's son Tony, a vice president in the family company, has fallen in love with a company stenographer , Alice Sycamore. When Tony proposes marriage, Alice is worried that his affluent family will look down on her family. In fact, Alice is the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Grandpa Martin Vanderhof. Other family members include Alice's parents Penny, a playwright, and Paul, who manufactures fireworks in the cellar; her sister Essie Carmichael, an aspiring dancer who makes homemade candies; and Essie's husband Ed, a musician and printer who delivers Essie's candies. Unbeknownst to the Kirbys, Alice's family lives in the house that will not sell. Grandpa is protecting not only his property but the families and businesses in the 12-block area Kirby wants. Kirby and his wife strongly disapprove of Tony's choice for marriage. Tony not only loves Alice but feels she encourages his taste for spontaneous fun and farcical humor. Before she accepts, Alice insists that Tony bring his parents to meet their future in-laws, but when Tony purposely brings his parents a day earlier than planned (reasoning that the two families should meet as they are, not in a formal \"stuffed-shirt\" setting), the Sycamore family is caught off-guard, and the house is in disarray. As the Kirbys are leaving after a disastrous meeting, the police arrive to arrest Ed for flyers he placed in Essie's candy boxes to advertise Paul's fireworks, and which the police perceive as communist propaganda . When the fireworks in the cellar accidentally go off, they arrest everyone in the house. Held in the drunk tank preparing to see the night-court judge, Mrs. Kirby repeatedly insults Alice and makes her feel unworthy of Tony, while Grandpa explains to Kirby the importance of having friends, and that despite all the wealth and success in business, \"you can't take it with you\". At the court hearing, the judge dismisses the charge for disturbing the peace against Grandpa and fines him $100 for the illegal fireworks; Grandpa's neighborhood friends pitch in to pay the fine. The judge refuses to dismiss the charges against the Kirbys unless they explain why they were at the Vanderhof house. Grandpa covers for the Kirbys by claiming it was to discuss selling the house, but Alice reveals it was because she was engaged to Tony, before spurning him because of how poorly she has been treated by his family. This causes a sensation in the papers, and Alice flees the city. With Alice gone, Grandpa sells the house, thus meaning all his neighbors must vacate their properties. As a result, the Kirby companies merge, creating a huge fluctuation in the stock market and ruining Ramsey, Kirby's competitor. Tony tells his father that he is quitting his job at the company, which he never wanted in the first place. Ramsey dies from a heart failure after confronting Kirby for being ruthless and a failure of a man, saying he too will end up ruined, alone and friendless. Realizing Ramsey was right, Kirby abruptly leaves the board meeting where the contract signing is scheduled to occur. As the Vanderhofs are vacating the house, Tony tries to speak with Alice, who locks herself in her room. Kirby arrives and talks privately with Grandpa, sharing his realization. Grandpa responds by inviting him to play a duet of \" Polly Wolly Doodle \" on the harmonica that he gave Kirby. The rest of the family join in the merriment, while Alice and Tony happily reconcile after Kirby expresses his approval of their marriage. Later, at the dinner table, Grandpa says grace for the Sycamore family and the Kirbys, revealing that Kirby has sold back the houses on the block.",

    "plot": "In Vienna , Lieutenant Nikolaus \"Niki\" von Preyn meets Franzi, the leader of an all-female-orchestra. They soon fall in love. While standing in formation at a parade honouring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki winks at Franzi in the crowd. Unfortunately the gesture is intercepted by Anna, the Princess of Flausenthurm. The naive princess takes offence; to assuage her, the lieutenant insists that he winked and smiled at her because of her beauty. This backfires; charmed and besotted, Anna demands that she marry the lieutenant, and threatens to marry an American if this plan is thwarted. Franzi leaves Niki upon seeing him return in a royal carriage. After intervention by the Emperor of Austria, an international incident is narrowly averted by the marriage of the lieutenant and the princess, though the marriage is not consummated, as Niki will only chastely kiss his bride—and his father-in-law. Homesick and lovesick, Niki wanders the streets, and encounters Franzi, who has continued to perform with her orchestra in Flausenthurm since the wedding, unable to move on. The two resume their romance. Anna finds out and confronts Franzi. During the confrontation, Franzi realizes that the princess is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant. She decides to save the marriage by giving the dowdy princess a makeover, and they sing the duet \"Jazz up your lingerie!\" before Franzi departs for good. The results are a complete success as the lieutenant returns home, follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing wife into the bedroom and closes the door – opening it briefly to give the audience a last song and suggestive wink.

    "plot": "After the pope dies of a heart attack, the College of Cardinals , under the leadership of its dean , Thomas Lawrence of the United Kingdom, convenes to elect a successor . The four cardinals who emerge as likely candidates are Aldo Bellini of the United States, a progressive reformer ; Joshua Adeyemi of Nigeria, a social conservative ; Joseph Tremblay of Canada, a moderate ; and Goffredo Tedesco of Italy, a staunch traditionalist . Archbishop Janusz Woźniak, the prefect of the papal household , tells Lawrence that the pope demanded Tremblay's resignation before dying, which Tremblay denies. Bellini, meanwhile, tells his supporters that his goal is to prevent Tedesco from winning the papacy. Lawrence is surprised by the last-minute arrival of Mexican-born Archbishop Vincent Benítez of Kabul , whom the pope named cardinal in pectore the previous year. [ a ] Lawrence opens the deliberations with an impromptu homily encouraging the college to embrace uncertainty, which some interpret as an open declaration of his papal ambition. No one obtains the two-thirds majority necessary to win, though Adeyemi commands a lead over Tedesco and Tremblay while Bellini and Lawrence split the progressive vote. Monsignor Raymond O'Malley, Lawrence's assistant, discovers the pope paid for Benítez to be flown to Geneva for a medical appointment that Benítez later cancelled. On the second day, the college witnesses an altercation between Adeyemi and Sister Shanumi, a Nigerian nun recently transferred to Vatican City. Lawrence speaks with Shanumi, who confesses to a past illicit relationship that led to the birth of a son. Adeyemi confirms the story when pressed. Though Lawrence is bound to secrecy , a whisper campaign derails Adeyemi's candidacy. Bellini reluctantly decides to back Tremblay. Working with Sister Agnes, the nun acting as head caterer and housekeeper, Lawrence discovers Tremblay arranged for Shanumi's transfer. When confronted, Tremblay claims he did so at the pope's request. Lawrence then breaks into the pope's sealed apartment, where he finds documents indicating Tremblay paid cardinals for votes . He shows the documents to Bellini, whose plea not to reveal their existence sparks an argument. On the third day, Lawrence and Agnes publicize Tremblay's actions, effectively removing him from contention. Lawrence then reconciles with Bellini and agrees to stand against Tedesco. He votes for himself during the deliberations, but before he can cast his vote, he is blown off his feet by an explosion that damages the Sistine Chapel . The college learns the explosion was part of a series of suicide bombings currently taking place throughout Europe. While Tedesco calls for a religious war against Islam , Benítez argues against meeting violence with violence and chastises everyone for prioritizing their political agendas over their shared religious mission. Voting resumes, and as light shines through a broken window, the college overwhelmingly elects Benítez, who chooses the papal name of Innocent XIV . Lawrence is initially enthusiastic until O'Malley pulls him aside to discuss Benítez's canceled medical appointment. He confronts Benítez, who reveals that he was born with a uterus and ovaries but was unaware of their existence until an appendectomy revealed them. The appointment was for a laparoscopic hysterectomy that he decided against, believing he should remain as God made him. Lawrence wanders the Vatican grounds, listening to the crowds cheer Pope Innocent's election, before returning to his room, opening the window, and observing a trio of young nuns chattering in the courtyard below.",

In truth, Terry comes from a wealthy Midwest family. Over the strong objections of her father, Henry Sims, she is determined to try to fulfill her dreams. In the boarding house, Terry's only supporter is aging actress Anne Luther, who appoints herself Terry's mentor and acting coach. When Powell sees Jean dancing, he decides to dump Linda.

She clings desperately to the hope of landing the leading role in Powell's new play, Enchanted April . She finally gets an appointment to see Powell, only to have him cancel. She faints in the reception area, the result of malnutrition and disappointment. Seeing this, Terry barges into Powell's private office and berates him for his callousness.  As a result, the other boarding house residents start to warm up to the newcomer.

He has dementia and constantly forgets important life events and where things are around his flat, including his watch. He tells Anne he believes his carer stole his watch and that he will never move out of his flat. She tells Anthony she is moving to Paris to be with a man, which confuses Anthony since he does not recall any men in her life since the end of her marriage to James. Anne says that if he keeps refusing to have a carer, she will have to move him into a nursing home. The next day, Anthony encounters an unknown man, Paul, in his flat. Paul says he is Anne's husband and that Anthony is living in their flat. Anne returns but appears to Anthony as a different woman. When a new carer, Laura, arrives for an interview, Anthony tells Laura he was a professional dancer and insists he does not need any assistance. Anthony later says Laura reminds him of his other daughter Lucy, whom he has not seen for a long time. Anthony is taken to a doctor and rejects the idea that he has memory problems. Later, he tells Laura how proud he is of Lucy, a painter. She tells him she is sorry about Lucy's accident, but Anthony is confused as he has no recollection of the accident. Over the course of the film, it becomes clear that Anthony has really been living with Anne for years, but believes he still lives in his own flat. After Anne comes home, she and her husband – who is sometimes called Paul and sometimes James, and appears as two different men – have an argument over a holiday that had to be cancelled because of Anthony's needs, and about Anne's sacrifices for her father. Paul asks Anthony how long he plans to stay in their flat and annoy everyone; this sequence of events is repeated later, and on the second occasion Paul slaps him. Anthony wakes up and walks out of the flat, finding himself in a hospital hallway. He remembers Lucy lying in a hospital bed with blood on her face. He then wakes up in a completely different bedroom, which is in a nursing home. His nurse arrives, having earlier appeared as both Anne and Laura, but now identifying herself as Catherine. She informs him that Anne lives in Paris and visits on occasional weekends. Another nurse named Bill also visits, identical to one of the men who earlier appeared to be Anne's husband.

He says he wants his mother and that he is \"losing his leaves, the branches, the wind and the rain\". Catherine comforts him and tells him she will take him out to the park later.",

As a grown man, Villa and a band of rebel bandits, including his trusted ally Sierra, kill wealthy landowners and become heroes to their fellow \"peons\". A wealthy aristocrat, Don Felipe, arranges an introduction for Villa to the distinguished and eloquent Francisco Madero , who resents what has become of Mexico under the rule of president Porfirio Díaz and persuades Villa to help him fight for liberty, not just for personal gain. The coarse and illiterate Villa is humbled in the presence of Madero and agrees to fight for his cause. He also is attracted to Don Felipe's beautiful sister Teresa, although there are many women in Villa's life, including one he is married to, Rosita. Villa's exploits are made even more colorful by an American newspaper reporter, Johnny Sykes, to whom Villa has taken a great liking. While drunk, Sykes is misinformed and reports that Villa has already overtaken the village of Santa Rosalia in a great victory for his men. Disobeying the orders of Madero and the arrogant General Pascal, simply to help his newspaper friend, Villa stages a raid on Santa Rosalia, as well as on Juarez. Madero ultimately assumes office in Mexico City, then commands Villa to disband his personal army. Villa agrees, but when Sierra kills a bank teller just so Villa can withdraw his money, Villa himself ends up sentenced to death.

Villa returns to Mexico and rebuilds his own army, recruiting tens of thousands to ride by his side. Together they storm the capital, where Pascal is subjected to a particularly gruesome death. Villa takes what he wants, but when Teresa resists and he physically assaults her, she draws a gun that her brother Don Felipe has given her for protection. Sierra intervenes and murders her. Villa appoints himself president but is ineffectual, unable to restore Madero's dream of land reform for Mexico's poor. He ultimately agrees to step aside and go back to where he belongs, including to his wife. Before he can, with Sykes by his side, Villa is gunned down by Don Felipe out of revenge for his sister.

    "plot": "In Qing dynasty China , Li Mu Bai is a renowned Wudang swordsman, and his friend Yu Shu Lien, a warrior, heads a private security company. Shu Lien and Mu Bai have long had feelings for each other, but because Shu Lien had been engaged to Mu Bai's close friend, Meng Sizhao [ 15 ] before his death, Shu Lien and Mu Bai feel bound by loyalty to Meng Sizhao and have not revealed their feelings to each other. Mu Bai, choosing to retire from the life of a swordsman , asks Shu Lien to give his fabled 400-year-old jian sword \"Green Destiny\" to their benefactor Sir Te in Beijing . Long ago, Mu Bai's teacher was killed by Jade Fox, a woman who sought to learn Wudang secrets. While at Sir Te's place, Shu Lien meets Yu Jiaolong, or Jen, who is the daughter of the rich and powerful Governor Yu and is about to get married. One evening, a masked thief sneaks into Sir Te's estate and steals the Green Destiny. Shu Lien intercepts the thief and chases them across the grounds and rooftops of Sir Te's compound, but the thief escapes after Shu Lien is distracted by a dart shot at her by an unknown source. Shu Lien and Sir Te's servant Master Bo trace the theft to Governor Yu's compound, where Jade Fox had been posing as Jen's governess for many years. Soon after, Mu Bai arrives in Beijing and discusses the theft with Shu Lien. Master Bo makes the acquaintance of Inspector Tsai from the local police , and his daughter May, who have come to Beijing in pursuit of Fox. Fox challenges the pair and Master Bo to a showdown that night.  Following a protracted battle, the group is on the verge of defeat when Mu Bai arrives and outmaneuvers Fox. She reveals that she killed Mu Bai's teacher because he would sleep with her, but refuse to take a woman as a disciple, and she felt it poetic justice for him to die at a woman's hand. Just as Mu Bai is about to kill her, the masked thief reappears and helps Fox. Fox kills Tsai before fleeing with the thief (who is revealed to be Jen). After seeing Jen fight Mu Bai, Fox realizes Jen had been secretly studying the Wudang manual. Fox is illiterate and could only follow the diagrams, whereas Jen's ability to read the manual allowed her to surpass her teacher in martial arts. At night, a bandit named Lo breaks into Jen's bedroom and asks her to leave with him. In the past, when Governor Yu and his family were traveling in the western deserts of Xinjiang , Lo and his bandits raided Jen's caravan and Lo stole her comb. She pursued him to his desert cave to retrieve her comb. However, the pair soon fell in love. Lo eventually convinced Jen to return to her family, though not before telling her a legend of a man who jumped off a mountain to make his wishes come true. Because the man's heart was pure, his wish was granted and he was unharmed, but flew away never to be seen again. Lo has come now to Beijing to persuade Jen not to go through with her arranged marriage. However, Jen refuses to leave with him. Later, Lo interrupts Jen's wedding procession, begging her to leave with him. Shu Lien and Mu Bai convince Lo to wait for Jen at Mount Wudang , where he will be safe from Jen's family, who are furious with him. Jen runs away from her husband on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. Disguised in men's clothing, she is accosted at an inn by a large group of warriors; armed with the Green Destiny and her own superior combat skills, she emerges victorious. Jen visits Shu Lien, who tells her that Lo is waiting for her at Mount Wudang. After an angry exchange, the two women engage in a duel. Shu Lien is the superior fighter, but Jen wields the Green Destiny and is able to destroy each weapon that Shu Lien wields, until Shu Lien finally manages to defeat Jen with a broken sword. When Shu Lien shows mercy, Jen wounds Shu Lien in the arm. Mu Bai arrives and pursues Jen into a bamboo forest, where he offers to take her as his student. Jen agrees if he can take Green Destiny from her in three moves. Mu Bai is able to take the sword in only one move, but Jen reneges on her promise, and Mu Bai throws the sword over a waterfall . Jen dives after the sword and is rescued by Fox. Fox puts Jen into a drugged sleep and places her in a cavern, where Mu Bai and Shu Lien discover her. Fox suddenly attacks them with poisoned needles. Mu Bai mortally wounds Fox, only to realize that one of the needles has hit him in the neck. Before dying, Fox confesses that her goal had been to kill Jen because Jen had hidden the secrets of Wudang's fighting techniques from her. Contrite, Jen leaves to prepare an antidote for the poisoned dart. With his last breath, Mu Bai finally confesses his love for Shu Lien. He dies in her arms as Jen returns. Shu Lien forgives Jen, telling her to go to Lo and always be true to herself. The Green Destiny is returned to Sir Te. Jen goes to Mount Wudang and spends the night with Lo. The next morning, Lo finds Jen standing on a bridge overlooking the edge of the mountain. In an echo of the legend that they spoke about in the desert, she asks him to make a wish. Lo wishes for them to be together again, back in the desert. Jen leaps from the bridge, falling into the mists below.",

    "plot": "Marcus Vinicius is a Roman military commander and the legate of the XIV Gemina . Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he stays in the house of Aulus Plautius , a retired Roman general, and becomes smitten with Lygia, a Lygian hostage of Rome in the old general's care. Unbeknownst to Marcus, Lygia, Aulus, and his household are devout Christians , who host Paul the Apostle that very night. Petronius , Marcus' uncle, persuades Nero to give the girl to his nephew as a reward for his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but eventually falls in love with Marcus. Meanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus; some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero's most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor's mind. Then, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him, too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. His slavegirl Eunice (who has fallen in love with him) elects to die with him, despite being freed. The Christian apostle Peter has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later crucified upside-down , a form of execution conceived by Nero's Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery. Poppaea , Nero's wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia's bodyguard Ursus must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor's box and forced to watch. This act outrages his loyal officers who are among the spectators. Ursus is able to topple the bull, though, and break its neck. At that moment Marcus manages to break free from his bonds and leaps into the arena to get to Lygia. Massively impressed by Ursus's victory and seeing that Lygia is the beloved of Marcus who is still regarded as a great war hero, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, Seneca , architect Phaon , poet Lucan , and musician Terpnos add their endorsement of the mob's demands. The decision enrages the crowd and Marcus's loyal troop members rush to the arena to save the three. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General Galba is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him as new Emperor of Rome . The crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to scapegoat the Christians. Then Acte , Nero's discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest , and he dies. Marcus, Lygia, and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus' estate in Sicily to begin a new life together. By the roadside, Peter's crook , which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms. A radiant light appears and a chorus intones, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life,\" words spoken by Jesus ( John 14:6, New Testament ).",

    "plot": "The Space Shuttle Explorer , commanded by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is in Earth orbit to service the Hubble Space Telescope . Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission, to perform hardware upgrades on the telescope. During a spacewalk , Mission Control in Houston warns Explorer ' s crew about a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris caused by the Russians shooting down a defunct spy satellite (see Kessler syndrome ), and orders the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly after, as more communication satellites are disabled by debris. Debris strikes the Explorer and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), rescues her and they return to the Explorer , discovering that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Kowalski decides they should use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450 km (900 mi) away. He estimates that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. On their way to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz spacecraft, with the remaining craft exhibiting damage and unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese Tiangong space station, [ N 1 ] 100 km (60 mi) away, to board its similar Shenzhou spacecraft and return to Earth. They try to grab onto the ISS, but only make tenuous connection to the Soyuz's parachute cords, which are not strong enough for them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself to save her from drifting away with him. Stone enters the ISS as Kowalski floats away. Unable to establish communication with him, she concludes that she is the mission's sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing Stone to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers it away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving. She performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong but discovers that the engine has no fuel. After an attempt at radio communication with an Inuk on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts off the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose consciousness , she experiences a hallucination of Kowalski telling her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong. Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets accordingly. Unable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting station. She enters Tiangong ' s Shenzhou capsule just as the station enters the upper atmosphere, and undocks. The Shenzhou capsule re-enters the atmosphere and lands in a lake. Radio communication from Houston informs Stone that she has been tracked on radar and that rescue crews are on their way. Stone opens the hatch and sheds her space suit , allowing her to reach the surface and crawl onto the beach before standing and walking away.",

She has placed her hopes on her son Paul, who has the talent and ambition to become an artist, a dream that is mocked by Walter. Paul finds his desire to escape to a different life sidetracked by his mother's possessiveness, as well as by local girl Miriam Leivers, with whom he has an intellectual relationship that he would like to become physical. Miriam, however, is torn between her feelings and the views of her mother, who views sex as sinful and dirty. Paul's brother Arthur dies in a mining accident, and the Morel's eldest son, William, returns home for the funeral. As William's train back to London is about to depart, he reveals that he is engaged to be married to a pretty woman from an affluent family, a woman who the Morels later learn is the temperamental opposite of Gertrude—light-spirited, and not particularly passionate or intellectual. When a sketch Paul made of his father is exhibited in Nottingham, he overhears a wealthy art patron criticize the work, but the man later comes to the Morel house to offer to pay for Paul to attend art school in London, as he recognizes Paul's potential as an artist. Excited, Paul tells Miriam, but she rejects his physical advances. When Paul gets home, his parents have just had a violent confrontation, and he decides to forego art school, as he cannot bear to leave his mother alone with his father. Paul takes a job in a local lace factory, where he becomes enchanted with Clara Dawes, a \"liberated\" feminist co-worker who is separated—but not divorced—from her husband, Baxter. Nonetheless, he continues seeing Miriam, and she finally agrees to have sex with him, but he immediately regrets convincing her to do so, as she did not seem to enjoy the experience, and he decides to stop seeing her. He and Clara begin a passionate affair, but he is not able to totally commit himself to her, in large part due to his mother's emotional hold on him. While Paul and Claire are away on a trip to the seaside, Baxter confronts Walter in a pub and tells him to keep Paul away from Claire. Walter blames Gertrude's clinginess for preventing Paul from being able to have a normal romantic relationship with a woman his age, but Gertrude says all she ever wanted was for Paul to be happy. Baxter is waiting for Paul when he returns from the trip, and, although Baxter wins the fight, he is injured. Clara, who has noted Paul's emotional distance, returns to her husband to nurse him back to health. Gertrude has not seemed well recently, and, one evening, Paul comes home to discover that she has had a heart attack. She says she no longer wishes to see Walter, as she wants to remember the days when they were in love and not be reminded of all of the negative aspects of their current relationship. She dies early the next morning, and Walter tells Paul to not let her down like he did, encouraging him to go to London and, hopefully, find some happiness. On a walk in the woods, Paul meets Miriam. She apologizes for his loss, and they learn that they are both going to London—Paul to attend art school, and Miriam to train to be a teacher. She suggests they marry so she can care for him, but Paul rejects her proposal, telling her that, after having belonged to his mother, he wants to stay free so he can learn \"what it means to live.\"",

    "plot": "In 1958 postwar Britain , Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from the former housekeeper, Miss Kenton, now Mrs. Benn. Their past employer, the Earl of Darlington , has died a broken man, his reputation destroyed by his pre–Second World War support of Nazi Germany, and his stately country house has been sold to retired US Congressman Jack Lewis. Allowed to borrow the Daimler , Stevens sets off for the West Country to see Miss Kenton for the first time in decades. In the 1930s, Kenton arrives at Darlington Hall, where the ever-efficient but deeply repressed Stevens derives his entire identity from his profession. He butts heads with the warmer, strong-willed Kenton, particularly when he refuses to acknowledge that his father, now an under-butler, is no longer able to perform his duties. Displaying total professionalism, Stevens carries on as his father lies dying during Darlington's conference of like-minded fascist -sympathising British and European aristocrats. Also in attendance is U.S. Congressman Lewis, who admonishes the \"gentleman politicians\" as meddling amateurs, advising that \"Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik \" and warning of impending disaster. Exposed to Nazi racial laws , Darlington gets Stevens to dismiss two newly hired refugee German-Jewish maids. Kenton threatens to resign but has nowhere to go, and a regretful Darlington is later unable to rehire the maids. At another conference, Stevens is unable to answer an aristocratic guest's questions on global trade and politics, which the aristocrat claims demonstrates the lower classes' ignorance and inability to govern themselves. Relations thaw between Stevens and Kenton, and she clearly shows her feelings for him. But the outwardly detached Stevens remains dedicated solely to his role as butler. She catches him reading a romance novel, which he explains is to improve his vocabulary, asking her not to invade his privacy again. Lord Darlington's godson, journalist Reginald Cardinal, arrives on the day of a secret meeting at Darlington Hall between the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain , and the German ambassador, Joachim von Ribbentrop . Appalled by his godfather's role in seeking appeasement for Nazi Germany , Cardinal tells Stevens that Darlington is being used by the Nazis , but Stevens feels it is not his place to judge his employer. Kenton forms a relationship with former co-worker Tom Benn and accepts his proposal of marriage. She informs Stevens as an ultimatum, but he will not admit his feelings and only offers his congratulations. Finding her crying, his only response is to call her attention to a neglected domestic task, and she leaves Darlington Hall before the start of the Second World War . En route to meeting Kenton in 1958, Stevens is mistaken for a gentleman at a pub. Doctor Carlisle, a local GP, helps him refuel the Daimler, deduces that he is actually a manservant, and asks his thoughts about Lord Darlington's actions. Initially denying having even met him, Stevens later admits to having served and respected him, noting that Darlington later confessed that his Nazi sympathies had been misguided and naive. Stevens tells Carlisle that, although Lord Darlington was unable to correct his error, he is attempting to correct his own. Stevens meets Kenton, who has separated from her husband and is staying at a boarding house on the coast. She and Stevens discuss how Lord Darlington died from a broken heart after suing a newspaper for libel, losing the suit and his reputation. Stevens mentions that Cardinal was killed in the war. Kenton declines to resume her position at Darlington Hall, wishing to remain near her pregnant daughter and, despite years of unhappiness, thinking about going back to her husband. Stevens supposes they may never meet again, and they part fondly but are both quietly upset, with Kenton visibly tearful as her bus pulls away. Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, where Lewis asks if he remembers what he had said at the conference in the 30s. Stevens replies that he was too busy serving to listen to the speeches. A pigeon flies into the fireplace from the chimney, and Lewis catches and sets it free. Stevens watches the bird as it flies away, leaving Darlington Hall far behind.",

    "plot": "A young woman sleeping alone in bed wakes to find bruises and wounds on her hips and upper inner thighs—injuries sustained from rape. In 2010, the women and girls of an isolated Mennonite colony discover that the men have been using livestock tranquilizer to subdue and rape them. The attackers are arrested and imprisoned in a nearby city. Most of the men of the colony travel to oversee the bail, leaving the women by themselves for two days to determine how they will proceed. They hold a plebiscite to decide whether to stay and do nothing, stay and fight, or leave. The vote is tied between staying and fighting, and leaving. Eleven of the colony's women are chosen to come to a final decision and gather in a hayloft, though Scarface Janz, a woman in the \"do nothing\" camp, leaves the meeting after becoming disillusioned with the discussion, taking her hesitant daughter Anna and resistant granddaughter Helena with her. August, the colony's schoolteacher and one of the only remaining men, joins the women to record the meeting, as none of the women were taught to read or write. Salome, just back from a trip to gather antibiotics to treat her assaulted four-year-old daughter, remains adamant about staying and fighting, an opinion shared by Mejal. Ona, who is pregnant after being raped, also suggests that they stay and, after winning the fight, create a new set of rules for the colony that would give the women equality. Mariche, Greta's daughter and Autje's mother, disagrees, believing that forgiveness is the only viable option. To defuse the conflict, Ona suggests that August create one document stating the pros and cons of leaving, and another document with those for staying. The meeting is adjourned. During the break, it is revealed that August is from an excommunicated family, but was recently granted permission to return and teach the boys of the colony. He and Ona were good friends in childhood, and he has had romantic feelings for her since, but she tells him she cannot marry him as she believes that she would cease to be her true self, the person he loves, if she marries. When some of the women go outside to be counted for the 2010 census , they learn that Klaas, Mariche's abusive husband, will return that evening to collect more bail money. The meeting resumes. Ona and Mejal change their minds in favor of leaving. Salome remains insistent upon fighting, angrily confessing that she would rather kill the men than put her daughter at risk any longer. However, she changes her opinion after being reminded by Agata, her and Ona's mother, of the principles of their faith. The only one remaining unconvinced is Mariche. An argument ensues between her and the rest of the women; it is revealed that she forgave her husband's abuse at Greta's urging. After Greta apologizes, Mariche agrees to leave. Their reasons for leaving are transcribed by August: to ensure the safety of their children, to be steadfast in their faith, and to have freedom of thought. They decide to try to take boys aged fifteen years and younger with them, but will not force any boy over age twelve. They prepare to leave at sunrise, concealing their plans from Klaas. August, at Ona's behest, posts the documents stating the pros and cons of leaving and staying on the walls as an \"artifact\" of the women's time in the colony. He also declares his love to Ona and gives her a map for the women to use. Before they can leave, Melvin (formerly Nettie), a transgender man who is selectively mute after an incestuous rape, speaking only to the colony's children, tells Salome that her teenage son Aaron has fled and hidden. He is found, but cannot be convinced to leave in enough time. Salome, breaking the rules the women set, sprays Aaron with tranquilizer, forcing him to leave with them. She reveals this only to August, who understands and does not question her. He asks her to look after Ona, and reveals his intent to kill himself once the women are gone. She instead asks him to teach the boys properly to prevent any further violence and to give him purpose. Helena and Anna join the rest of the women, while Janz and August watch as they depart. Sometime later, Ona's newborn baby is shown, and Autje is heard saying that it will live a life very different from the one the women endured.",

Nine years earlier, in 1527, Henry has a problem: he reveals his dissatisfaction with his wife, Catherine of Aragon . He is enjoying a discreet affair with Mary Boleyn , a daughter of one of his courtiers, Sir Thomas Boleyn , but the king is bored with her too. At a court ball , he notices Mary's eighteen-year-old sister, Anne , who has returned from her education in France . She is engaged to the son of the Earl of Northumberland , and they have received their parents' permission to marry. The king, however, is enraptured with Anne's beauty and orders Cardinal Wolsey , his Lord Chancellor , to break the engagement. When news of this decision is carried to Anne, she reacts furiously. She blames the cardinal and the king for ruining her happiness. When Henry makes a rather clumsy attempt to seduce her, Anne bluntly informs him how she finds him. Henry brings her back to court with him, and she continues to resist his advances out of a mixture of repulsion for Henry and her lingering anger over her broken engagement. However, she becomes intoxicated with the power that the king's love gives her. Using this power, she continually undermines Cardinal Wolsey, who initially sees Anne as a passing love interest for the king. When Henry again presses Anne to become his mistress , she repeats that she never will give birth to an illegitimate child. Desperate to have a son, Henry suddenly comes up with the idea of marrying Anne in Catherine's place. Anne is stunned, but she agrees.

When she is told that she has been accused of adultery, Anne laughs until she sees her brother being brought into the Tower and learns he faces the same accusation. At Anne's trial, she manages to cross-question Mark Smeaton , the tortured servant who finally admits that the charges against Anne were lies. Henry makes an appearance, then visits Anne in her chambers that night. He offers her freedom if she will agree to annul their marriage and make their daughter illegitimate. Anne refuses, saying that she would rather die than betray their daughter, whom she claims will rule after Henry. He slaps her and tells her that her disobedience will mean her death.

He feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his own failure to help Vincent and to reconcile with Anna, who has become cold and distant towards Malcolm. Lynn worries about her son Cole, especially after seeing mysterious signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, when bullies see that Cole is scared of a cupboard, they lock him in it, causing him to scream in terror about someone seemingly inside with him.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal . The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England , makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase but he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the Khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the Khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa. Disraeli is elated when he receives the news. However, Myers comes and informs him that his banking house has been driven into bankruptcy by sabotage; the cheque is worthless. Disraeli tells him to keep his situation secret for the moment. When the prying Mrs. Travers arrives, Disraeli allows her to learn of the purchase, and she exultantly admits to her key part in sabotaging Myers. Thinking quickly, Disraeli summons Probert. Though the banker initially refuses to help, Disraeli forces him to sign a paper giving unlimited credit to Myers by threatening to have Parliament revoke the bank's charter. (After Probert leaves, Disraeli confesses to his wife and Clarissa that he was bluffing.) Myers' solvency is restored, the deal is completed, and as a result of Disraeli's success, Queen Victoria can add Empress of India to her other titles. Disraeli is honored when he and his wife, who has recovered from serious illness, attend a reception for the Queen.",

Irving loves Sydney but is unwilling to leave his unstable, histrionic wife, Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with adopted son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. FBI agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English but has proof that her aristocratic claim is fraudulent. She tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, which distances her from Irving. Irving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving's suggests the sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden, New Jersey , who is trying to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City , but has struggled to find investors. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area's economy and his constituents. Richie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a sting operation , despite the objections of Irving and of Richie's boss Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2 million. When Stoddard's boss Anthony Amado hears of the operation, he praises Richie's initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue. Carmine leaves the meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces him the sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and they become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheikh, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheikh, which displeases Irving. Carmine brings the sheikh to a casino party, explaining that mobsters are there and that it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that Mafia boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to Meyer Lansky , is present and wants to meet the sheikh. Tellegio explains that the sheikh needs to become an American citizen, and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10 million wire transfer to prove the sheikh's legitimacy. Richie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from Albuquerque . Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the IRS , causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheikh's investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet but wants a divorce. With Carmine's help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money and later convinces Amado he needs the $10 million to get Tellegio, but he gets only $2 million. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio's lawyer Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear. Irving visits Carmine and admits to the scam but says he has a plan to help him. Carmine throws Irving out, and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2 million is missing and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney's immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. It is revealed that Alfonse Simone, with whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer, was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal, and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The congressmen are prosecuted, and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison.

To soothe her wounded pride and embarrass Bastide, she seeks to arrange the seduction and disgrace of his young virgin fiancée, Cécile de Volanges, who has only recently been presented to society after spending her formative years in the shelter of a convent . Merteuil calls on the similarly unprincipled Vicomte de Valmont, another ex-lover of hers, to do the deed. Valmont declines as he is plotting to seduce Madame de Tourvel, the devoutly religious wife of a member of Parliament and a current guest of Valmont's aunt, Madame de Rosemonde. Amused and incredulous at Valmont's hubris, Merteuil ups the ante: if Valmont somehow succeeds in seducing Tourvel and can furnish written proof, Merteuil will sleep with him as well. Never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont accepts. Tourvel rebuffs all of Valmont's advances. Searching for leverage, he instructs his page Azolan to seduce Tourvel's maid, Julie and gain access to Tourvel's private correspondence. One of the letters intercepted is from Cécile's mother and Merteuil's cousin, Madame de Volanges, warning Tourvel that Valmont is nefarious and untrustworthy. Valmont resolves to seduce Cécile as revenge for her mother's accurate denunciation of him. At the opera, Cécile meets the charming and handsome Chevalier Danceny, who becomes her music teacher. They fall in love with coaxing from Merteuil, who knows that Danceny, as a nobleman of lesser rank, naive, young, and not particularly wealthy, can never qualify as a bona fide suitor. Valmont gains access to Cécile's bedchamber on a pretext and sexually assaults her. As she pleads with him to leave, he blackmails her into giving up physical resistance, and the scene ends. On the pretext of illness, Cécile remains locked in her chambers, refusing all visitors. A concerned Madame de Volanges asks Merteuil to speak to Cécile; Cécile confides in Merteuil, naively assuming that she has Cécile's best interests at heart. Merteuil advises Cécile to welcome Valmont's advances; she says young women should take advantage of all the lovers they can acquire in a society so repressive and contemptuous of women. The result is a \"student-teacher\" relationship; by day, Cécile is courted by Danceny, and each night, she receives a sexual \"lesson\" from Valmont. Merteuil begins an affair with Danceny. After a night in Valmont's bed, Cécile miscarries her child. Meanwhile, Valmont has won Tourvel's heart, but at a cost: the lifelong bachelor playboy falls in love. In a fit of jealousy, Merteuil mocks Valmont and refuses to honor her end of their agreement unless Valmont breaks up with Tourvel. Valmont abruptly dismisses Tourvel with a terse excuse, suggested by Merteuil: \"It's beyond my control.\" Overwhelmed with grief and shame, Tourvel retreats to a monastery where her health deteriorates rapidly. Despite the breakup, Merteuil still refuses to honor the agreement and, provoked to do so by Valmont, declares \"war\". She informs Danceny that Valmont has been sleeping with Cécile. Danceny challenges Valmont to a duel, ending with the latter voluntarily running into Danceny's sword. With his dying breath, Valmont asks Danceny to communicate to Tourvel his true feelings for her; he also warns Danceny about Meurteuil and gives him his collection of intimate letters from her as proof of the veracity of his warnings. Valmont tells Danceny to circulate them after he has read them. After hearing Valmont's message from Danceny, Tourvel dies. Meanwhile, following Valmont's death, Merteuil sinks into madness and pain. Later, she attends a show at the opera but leaves after being booed by her former friends and sycophants, implying that all of Paris has learned the full range of her schemes and depredations due to Danceny's circulation of the letters.",

He goes to a bar, ignores a woman's obvious request for casual sex, and gets into a fistfight with two men. One day, he receives a phone call informing him that his brother Joe, a fisherman who lives in Manchester-by-the-Sea , has suffered cardiac arrest ; Joe dies before Lee can reach the hospital. Lee insists on being the one to tell Joe's teenage son Patrick about his death. While making funeral arrangements, they are reminded Joe's body cannot be buried until spring as the ground is frozen. Lee makes plans to remain in Manchester, living in Joe's house until the delayed burial. When Lee meets with Joe's attorney, he is shocked to discover Joe has named him Patrick's legal guardian. Flashbacks reveal that Lee once lived in Manchester with his then-wife Randi and their three children. One night after hosting a raucous party, an intoxicated Lee forgot to put the screen in front of the fireplace, leading to a house fire that killed his children. No criminal charges were filed against him, as the police ruled it a tragic accident. However, at the station, a guilt-ridden Lee stole an officer's gun and attempted suicide, before being subdued. Lee and Randi subsequently divorced, and he left town. He is reluctant to commit to the guardianship, as it would require him to move back to Manchester. Plans are begun for Patrick to move to Boston with Lee, but Patrick has strong ties to the Manchester community and stubbornly objects. Lee commits to staying until the end of the school year. Patrick wants to live with his estranged mother Elise, who still lives in the area. Lee is opposed to this as her history with alcoholism led her to abandon her family, but Patrick decides to reconnect with her over lunch. Elise has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fiancé Jeffrey, but during an awkward meal with them, Patrick finds he is unable to connect with her. He is further unsettled when Jeffrey emails him and insists on being an intermediary in any future communication between them. Lee's positive comments about Elise's sobriety lead Patrick to believe his uncle is trying to get rid of him, assertions Lee denies. In response to this strain in their relationship, Lee takes steps to possibly extend his stay in Manchester and seeks to spend more time with Patrick. Over time, they re-establish their bond, despite conflicts over Joe's boat, Patrick's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. However, staying in Manchester is still painful for Lee, as he is surrounded by reminders of his past. Multiple scenes suggest that some residents of Manchester believe that the fire was not accidental. One day, Lee runs into Randi with her newborn child.

    "obfuscated_plot": "A depressed and asocial maintenance worker who lives alone in a basement apartment in a small coastal town goes to a bar, ignores a woman's obvious request for casual sex, and gets into a fistfight with two men. One day, he receives a phone call informing him that his brother, a fisherman, has suffered cardiac arrest; the brother dies before he can reach the hospital. He insists on being the one to tell his brother's teenage son about his death. While making funeral arrangements, they are reminded the body cannot be buried until spring as the ground is frozen. The maintenance worker makes plans to remain in town, living in his brother's house until the delayed burial. When he meets with his brother's attorney, he is shocked to discover his brother has named him the teenager's legal guardian.\n\nFlashbacks reveal that he once lived in the same town with his then-wife and their three children. One night after hosting a raucous party, an intoxicated maintenance worker forgot to put the screen in front of the fireplace, leading to a house fire that killed his children. No criminal charges were filed, as the police ruled it a tragic accident. However, at the station, a guilt-ridden maintenance worker stole an officer's gun and attempted suicide, before being subdued. He and his wife subsequently divorced, and he left town. He is reluctant to commit to the guardianship, as it would require him to move back to the town.\n\nPlans are begun for the teenager to move to a larger city with the maintenance worker, but the teenager has strong ties to the local community and stubbornly objects. The maintenance worker commits to staying until the end of the school year. The teenager wants to live with his estranged mother, who still lives in the area. The maintenance worker is opposed to this due to her history with alcoholism, but the teenager decides to reconnect with her over lunch.\n\nThe mother has committed to Christianity and sobriety with her fiancé, but during an awkward meal, the teenager finds he is unable to connect with her. Over time, the maintenance worker and teenager re-establish their bond, despite conflicts over the brother's boat, the teenager's girlfriends, and their future living arrangements. However, staying in town is still painful for the maintenance worker, as he is surrounded by reminders of his past.\n\nOne day, he runs into his ex-wife with her newborn child. A sobbing ex-wife expresses remorse for her treatment of him during their divorce and asks him to have lunch. He deflects her apology, feeling that he does not deserve it. Distraught, he gets drunk at a bar, picks a fight with strangers, and is knocked out.\n\nThe maintenance worker arranges for a local couple to adopt the teenager so that he can remain in town while he takes a job in the larger city. When the teenager asks why he cannot remain together, the maintenance worker says that he \"can't beat it\". In the final scene, they go fishing on the inherited boat, symbolizing a tentative reconciliation and hope for the future."

    "name": "Doctor Zhivago",
    "plot": "NKVD Lieutenant General Yevgraf Zhivago searches for the daughter of his half-brother Dr. Yuri Zhivago and Larissa (\"Lara\") Antipova. Yevgraf believes a young dam worker, Tanya Komarova, may be his niece and explains to her why. After his mother's burial, the orphaned child Yuri, owning only an inherited balalaika , was taken by family friends Alexander and Anna Gromeko to Moscow . In 1913, Zhivago, now a doctor and poet, becomes engaged to the Gromekos' daughter Tonya after her schooling in Paris . Meanwhile, 17-year-old Lara is seduced by her mother's much older friend/lover, the well-connected Victor Komarovsky. Lara's friend, the idealistic Pasha Antipov, who wishes to marry her, is wounded by mounted police at a peaceful demonstration. Lara treats Pasha's wound, and hides a gun he picked up. Discovering Lara's relationship with Komarovsky, her mother attempts suicide. Komarovsky attempts to dissuade Lara from marrying Pasha. She refuses and he rapes her. A traumatised Lara later follows Komarovsky to a party, shoots him in the arm, and is escorted out by Pasha. Pasha marries her, despite now knowing about her relationship with Komarovsky. They leave Moscow. During World War I, Yuri, now married to Tonya, becomes a battlefield doctor. Pasha joins up, but is reported missing. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him and encounters Zhivago. For six months, they serve at a field hospital , as unrest grows in Russia after exiled Vladimir Lenin returns. The two fall in love, but Zhivago remains faithful to Tonya. After Russia leaves the war, Yuri returns to Tonya, their son Sasha and the widowed Alexander Gromeko in their Moscow house, which was confiscated by the Soviet government and now houses many other people. Yevgraf, now a Cheka officer, tells Yuri his poems have been condemned as anti-communist. Yevgraf provides documents so the family can travel to the Gromekos' country home, \"Varykino\", in the Urals near Yuriatin. Their heavily guarded train travels through contested territory where Bolshevik commander Strelnikov is fighting anti-communist White forces. The train stops near Strelnikov's armored train. Yuri gets out, is captured and taken to Strelnikov, whom Yuri recognizes as Pasha. Strelnikov mentions that Lara lives in Yuriatin, now White-occupied. Strelnikov lets Zhivago return to his train. The family find the main house at Varykino sealed up by the Bolsheviks; they settle into a neighboring cottage. In Yuriatin, Yuri sees Lara, and they begin an affair. When Tonya is about to give birth to a second child, Yuri breaks off with Lara but is forcibly enlisted by Communist partisans. After two years, Yuri deserts and returns to Yuriatin. Lara says Tonya contacted her while searching for Yuri. Leaving his belongings with Lara, she returned to Moscow. Tonya later sent Lara a sealed letter for Yuri. Tonya had borne a daughter, and she, her father, and two children are living in Paris following deportation. Yuri and Lara become lovers again but Komarovsky arrives. Cheka agents have been watching them due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov. Komarovsky offers them help escaping Russia, but they refuse, instead going to Varykino, and hiding in the main house. Yuri begins the \"Lara\" poems, which will bring him fame but government disapproval. Komarovsky arrives with troops. Recently appointed as a Far Eastern Republic official, he says the Cheka allowed Lara to remain in the area only to lure Strelnikov. He was subsequently captured five miles away and committed suicide on his way to execution by grabbing a guard's gun so they now intend to arrest Lara. Komarovsky's offer of safe passage is accepted, but once Lara is on her way, Yuri does not follow. On the train, Lara tells Komarovsky she is pregnant by Yuri. Years later, Yevgraf finds a Moscow medical job for his now frail half-brother. Yuri sees Lara in the street but suffers a fatal heart attack before reaching her. At Yuri's funeral, Lara asks Yevgraf for help finding her daughter by Yuri, who vanished during the civil war. Yevgraf helps her search the orphanages, in vain. Lara then disappears and Yevgraf believes she died in a gulag . Yevgraf believes that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter; she remains unconvinced. Asked how she became lost, Tanya answers that her \"father\" (Komarovsky) let go of her hand when they were running from bombardment. Yevgraf responds that a real father would not have let go. Tanya promises to consider Yevgraf's words. Her boyfriend David arrives, and she leaves with him. Yevgraf notices Tanya carries a balalaika. He asks if she can play, and David replies, \"She's an artist!\", and says she is untrained. Yevgraf responds, \"Ah... then it's a gift!\"",

    "plot": "In 1951, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea is assigned two new surgeons, \"Hawkeye\" Pierce and \"Duke\" Forrest , who arrive in a stolen Jeep . They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they prove to be excellent combat surgeons. Other characters include the bungling commanding officer Henry Blake , his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly , dentist Walter \"Painless Pole\" Waldowski, the pompous and incompetent surgeon Frank Burns , and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy . The main characters in the camp divide into two factions. Irritated by Frank's religious fervor, Hawkeye and Duke get Blake to move him to another tent so newly arrived chest surgeon Trapper John McIntyre can move in. The three doctors (the \"Swampmen\", after the nickname for their tent) have little respect for military protocol, having been drafted into the Army, and are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. Frank is a straitlaced military officer who wants things done by the book, as is Margaret Houlihan , who has been assigned to the 4077th as head nurse. The two bond over their respect for regulations and begin a love affair. With help from Radar, the Swampmen sneak a microphone into a tent where the couple are engaging in sex and broadcast their encounter over the camp's public address system, embarrassing them and earning Houlihan the nickname \"Hot Lips\". The next morning, Hawkeye goads Frank into assaulting him, resulting in the latter's removal from the camp for psychiatric evaluation. Later, when Houlihan is showering, the Swampmen pull the tent sides off and expose her, in order to settle a bet over whether she is a natural blonde. Houlihan confronts Blake for his weak leadership and threatens to resign her commission; Blake bluntly tells her she can do so. Painless, described as \"best-equipped dentist in the Army\" and \"the dental Don Juan of Detroit\", becomes depressed over an incident of impotence and announces his intent to commit suicide, believing that he has turned homosexual. The Swampmen agree to help him carry out the deed, staging a feast to evoke Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper , arranging for Father Mulcahy to give Painless absolution and communion, and providing him with a \"black capsule\" (actually a sleeping pill) to speed him on his way. Hawkeye persuades the gorgeous Lieutenant \"Dish\" Schneider — who has remained faithful to her husband and is being transferred back to the United States for discharge — to spend the night with Painless and allay his concern about his \" latent homosexuality \". The next morning, Painless is his usual cheerful self, and a smiling Dish departs for home in a helicopter. Hawkeye and Trapper agree to temporary duty in Japan to operate on a Congressman's son as a way of playing golf. When they also perform an unauthorized operation on a local infant, they face disciplinary action from the hospital commander for misusing Army resources. Trapper uses anesthetic gas to sedate the commander. Using staged photographs of him as he awakens in bed with a prostitute, they blackmail him into keeping his mouth shut. Blake and General Hammond organize a football game between the 4077th and the 325th Evac Hospital and heavily wager on the outcome. At Hawkeye's suggestion, Blake applies to have a specific neurosurgeon — Dr. Oliver Harmon \"Spearchucker\" Jones , a former professional football player for the San Francisco 49ers — transferred to the 4077th as a ringer . Hawkeye also suggests Blake bet half his money up front and keep Jones out of the first half of the game. The 325th scores repeatedly and easily, even after the 4077th drugs one of their star players to incapacitate him. Hammond confidently offers high odds, against which Blake bets the rest of his money. Jones enters the second half, which quickly devolves into a free-for-all, and the 4077th gets the 325th's second ringer thrown out of the game and wins with a final trick play. Not long after the football game, Hawkeye and Duke get their discharge orders and begin their journey home — taking the same stolen Jeep in which they arrived. [ 8 ]",

    "plot": "In mid-August 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, the editor of the New York Morning Globe , Mr. Powers ( Harry Davenport ), sends crime reporter John Jones, using the pen name \"Huntley Haverstock\" ( Joel McCrea ), to Europe to report on conditions there. Jones's first assignment is to interview a Dutch diplomat named Van Meer ( Albert Bassermann ), at a luncheon. Jones/Haverstock shares a cab with Van Meer on the way to the luncheon. He peppers him with questions about the impending war, but Van Meer evades answering. Once at the event, Jones becomes smitten with Carol ( Laraine Day ) who has some uncertain role at the meeting. He invites her to sit at his table saying none of the reporters will listen to the speeches. A charming host, Stephen Fisher ( Herbert Marshall ), the leader of the Universal Peace Party, makes the announcement that their keynote speaker, Van Meer, has taken ill and won't appear. In his stead, the host has his daughter, Carol, speak. Jones realizes he has inadvertently insulted the woman he now adores. The newspaper editor, Powers, sends Jones on to Amsterdam to cover Van Meer's next appearance, at a conference of the Universal Peace Party. When Jones stops to greet Van Meer outside the conference hall, Van Meer seems to be in some kind of hypnotic state and does not recognize him. Suddenly, an eager photographer moves to take a photo of the Dutch diplomat – actually concealing a gun near the camera. He assassinates Van Meer. Jones runs after the shooter and ends up encountering Carol and a reporter friend of hers, Scott ffolliott ( George Sanders ). They give chase in his car. Outside the city, they seem to lose sight of the car they have been following, but Jones suspects that the assassin is hiding in a windmill. While Carol and ffolliott go for the police, Jones searches the windmill and finds Van Meer alive, but heavily drugged. All Van Meer can manage to convey is that the man shot in front of witnesses earlier was an imposter. Jones narrowly escapes the windmill to tell the police that Van Meer is alive. When they all return to the scene with authorities, Van Meer and his kidnappers are gone. Later, back at Jones's hotel room in Amsterdam, two spies posing as police officers arrive to kidnap him. When he suspects who they really are, he escapes out of his hotel bathroom window. He runs into Carol again. Jones and Carol board a British ship to England. Amidst a furious storm, Jones proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. In England, they go to Carol's father's house, where Jones sees Krug ( Eduardo Ciannelli ), whom he recognizes from the windmill as the operative running the assassination and kidnapping. Fisher and Krug realize Jones knows too much, and Krug convinces Fisher that he must be killed.  Fisher tells Jones he is in danger and offers a bodyguard to protect him. The bodyguard, Rowley ( Edmund Gwenn ), takes Jones to the top of Westminster Cathedral tower ostensibly to ditch anyone following them and to show Jones the view. Suddenly, the bodyguard tries to shove Jones off the tower, going over the side to his own death, instead. Jones and ffolliott are convinced that Fisher is a traitor, so they come up with a plan: Jones will take Carol to Cambridge , and ffolliott will pretend she has been kidnapped, in order to force Fisher to divulge Van Meer's location. Carol agrees to go, thinking that the purpose of their trip is to protect Jones by getting him out of London. When she overhears Jones booking two adjoining rooms at an inn, she believes that Jones has tricked her into leaving London for a premarital sexual encounter. She returns home alone and earlier than ffolliott expected, foiling his attempt to extract Van Meer's location from her father. ffolliott then trails Fisher to a closed hotel where Van Meer is being held prisoner. He is captured at gunpoint and brought into the room where the spy ring is holding a drugged Van Meer, torturing him with bright lights and loud jazz music. Fisher fails to persuade Van Meer to reveal the details of a secret clause in a treaty, Clause 27 (the movie's MacGuffin [ 2 ] ). Fisher then has Van Meer physically tortured until he begins to recite the clause, which would be triggered if Germany goes to war. ffolliot starts to fight Fisher's thugs to interrupt Van Meer, and then escapes. Jones and a fellow reporter arrive, and the three rescue Van Meer. Fisher flees. Van Meer is taken to a nearby hospital, where he slowly regains consciousness. Britain and France declare war on Germany. Jones and ffolliott follow the Fishers onto a Short S.30 Empire flying boat to America. When Fisher intercepts a telegram intended for ffolliott, telling him that Van Meer has recovered and identified Fisher as his kidnapper, Fisher realizes he will soon be captured and returned to England. He confesses his treasonous behavior to Carol, who already suspects the truth but promises to stand by him. Jones pleads with Carol to rekindle their affair. Seconds later, the aircraft is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean. The survivors perch on the floating wing of the downed aircraft. Realizing that the wing cannot support everyone, Fisher slips into the ocean to drown, dying for his cause while also sacrificing himself so the rest will survive. An American ship rescues the survivors. The captain refuses to allow the reporters to file their stories using the ship's communications, citing American neutrality in the war. Still, Jones, ffolliott, and Carol surreptitiously communicate the story by radio-telephone to Mr. Powers. Jones returns to England and, with Carol at his side, becomes a successful war correspondent. During a live radio broadcast, he describes London being bombed, urging Americans to \"keep those lights burning\" as they go dark in the studio.",

    "plot": "Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski, three agents from the Soviet Board of Trade, arrive in Paris to sell jewelry confiscated from the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1917 . Count Alexis Rakonin, a White Russian nobleman reduced to employment as a waiter in the hotel where the trio are staying, overhears details of their mission and informs the former Russian Grand Duchess Swana that her family jewels are to be sold by the three men. Swana's debonair paramour, Count Léon d'Algout, offers to help retrieve the jewelry before it is sold. In their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski are negotiating with Mercier, a prominent Parisian jeweler, when Léon interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels were seized illegally by the Soviet government and a petition has been filed in Paris preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewelry until the lawsuit is settled. The amiable, charming and cunning Léon treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their friendship and confidence. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise. Displeased by the telegram, Moscow then sends Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova, a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewelry sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission. Ninotchka and Léon first meet on the street near the hotel, their identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, Léon follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Ninotchka tells him he might be an interesting subject of study and suggests they go to his apartment. Léon, fascinated by Ninotchka, continues to flirt and he soon falls in love with her. They kiss, but are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Both then realize they are each other's adversaries over the jewelry and Ninotchka promptly leaves Léon's apartment, despite his protestations. The next day, Léon follows Ninotchka to a working class bistro where she again rebuffs him. However, after valiant attempts at making her laugh, Léon finally breaks down her resistance and she falls in love with him. \nWhile attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the West. At a dinner date with Léon where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewelry and for Léon's affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakened by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewelry during the night. Swana has come to offer Ninotchka a proposition: the jewels will be returned and the litigation dropped if Ninotchka returns to Moscow immediately so that Swana can have Léon to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees to Swana's proposal and, after completing the sale of the jewelry to Mercier, she, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski fly back to Russia.\nLater that evening, Léon visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs Léon that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility. Sometime later in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to dinner at her communal apartment and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. After dinner, Ninotchka finally receives a letter from Léon, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated. More time passes. Commissar Razinin informs Ninotchka that Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski were sent to Constantinople to sell furs but once again have failed to complete their mission. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is again sent by Razinin to investigate the situation and retrieve the trio. After Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, the three Russians inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to the Soviet Union. When Ninotchka asks them who is responsible for this idea, Buljanoff points to the balcony where Léon is standing. Léon explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski conspired to get her to leave the country. He asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees. The final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because, unlike theirs, his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant.",

J. \"Jake\" Gittes to trail her husband, Hollis, the chief engineer at the Department of Water and Power . Gittes photographs Hollis in the company of a young woman and the pictures make their way into the Post-Record , exposing their apparent affair. Gittes is then confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. He concludes that the imposter was using him to discredit Hollis. Gittes crosses paths with his former colleague, LAPD Lieutenant Lou Escobar, when Hollis's corpse is found in a reservoir. Investigating further, he discovers that huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir each night, despite the fact that the city is in the midst of a drought. Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill warns him off, and he has his nose slashed by one of Mulvihill's henchmen. Now working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Hollis's death. He learns that Hollis was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he finds Hollis's supposed mistress, who has disappeared. Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, the woman who posed as Evelyn. She refuses to say who hired her, but urges Gittes to check the Post-Record 's obituary section. Public records reveal that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. Gittes recognizes one of the buyers' names from the obituary section; the obituary indicates that he had been dead for a week when the deal was closed. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home where the buyer had lived and discover that many of the other residents are \" buyers \" too, although they have no knowledge of this fact. A suspicious staff member calls Mulvihill, but Gittes and Evelyn escape him and his thugs and hide at her mansion, where they sleep together. Later that night, Gittes follows Evelyn to a house where he sees her comforting the missing girl. When confronted, Evelyn claims the girl is her sister, Katherine. A call from Escobar summons Gittes to Ida's apartment; she has been murdered. Escobar reveals that Hollis had saltwater in his lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the reservoir. He suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray residence, Gittes retrieves a pair of glasses \nfrom the saltwater garden pond. Gittes confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom she now claims is her daughter. Frustrated, he repeatedly slaps Evelyn until she breaks down and reveals that Katherine is both her sister and daughter; the girl's father is Cross, who impregnated Evelyn when she was 15. She tells Gittes that the glasses he found did not belong to Hollis. Gittes arranges for the women to flee to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown . He summons Cross to the Mulwray estate, having deduced that Cross dropped his glasses when he drowned Hollis in the pond. Cross reveals that he is behind both the water shortage and the land grab in the Northwest Valley. Once the land is his, he will obtain a contract from the city to build a reservoir there. He discredited and killed Hollis when the latter came close to uncovering the plan. At gunpoint, Cross and Mulvihill force Gittes to take them to Chinatown, where the police are waiting. Escobar detains Gittes as Cross attempts to claim Katherine. Evelyn shoots Cross in the arm and tries to escape with Katherine, but the police open fire, killing her. Cross takes a distraught Katherine away, and Escobar orders Gittes released. As the traumatised Gittes is led away by his associates, one tells him, \"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\" [ a ]",

Lieutenant Stone, a \"cub\" (meaning a newly commissioned officer), eagerly anticipated serving on the Indian frontier, particularly because he specifically was requested and assumed that his father sent for him; Lieutenant Forsythe, an experienced cavalrymen and something of a teasing character, was sent out as a replacement for an officer who was killed in action. After his arrival Lieutenant Stone discovers that his father keeps him at arms length, wanting to treat him the same as he treats all of the other men. He also reveals that he did not request his son serve in his regiment, a discovery that breaks his heart and leads to him going on a drunken bender. Attempting to show impartiality, the colonel treats his son indifferently. The Colonel's commitment to strictly military behavior and adherence to protocol is interpreted by young Stone as rejection. He had not seen his father since he was a boy and had looked forward to spending time with him. Lieutenant Barrett, disguised as a native rebel in order to spy on Mohammed Khan, reports that Khan is preparing an uprising against the British. He plans to intercept and hijack a military convoy transporting two million rounds of ammunition. When Khan discovers that Colonel Stone knows of his plan, he orders Tania Volkanskaya, a beautiful Russian agent, to seduce and kidnap Lieutenant Stone in an attempt to extract classified information about the ammunition caravan from him, or use him as leverage to attract his father. When the colonel refuses to attempt his son's rescue, McGregor and Forsythe, appalled by the seeming lack of concern the colonel has for his own son, leave the camp at night without orders. Disguised as native merchants trying to sell blankets, they successfully get inside Khan's fortress. However, they are recognized by Tania, who had met the two men at a social event. McGregor and Forsythe are taken prisoner. During interrogation, Khan wants to know when and where the munitions will be transported so that he can attack and steal the arms. He has the prisoners tortured for the information. Bamboo shoots are shoved under their fingernails and set on fire. McGregor and Forsythe refuse to talk, but the demoralized Stone, feeling rejected by his father, cracks and reveals what he knows. As a result, the ammunition convoy is captured. After receiving news of the stolen ammunition, Colonel Stone takes the 41st to battle Khan. From their cell, the captives see the overmatched Bengal Lancers deploy to assault Khan's fortress. They manage to escape and blow up the ammunition tower, McGregor manning a machine gun and dying in the assault. Young Stone redeems himself by killing Khan with a dagger. With their ammunition gone, their leader dead, and their fortress in ruins, the remaining rebels surrender. In recognition of their bravery and valor in battle, Lieutenants Forsythe and Stone are awarded the Distinguished Service Order . McGregor posthumously receives the Victoria Cross , Great Britain's highest award for military valor, with Colonel Stone pinning the medal to the saddle cloth of McGregor's horse in the custom in the 41st Lancers.",

    "plot": "C.C. \"Bud\" Baxter is a lonely minor office worker at a large insurance company in New York City. To climb the corporate ladder, he allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their extramarital affairs. Baxter meticulously juggles the \"booking\" schedule; overheard sounds of women and partying from his apartment and empty liquor bottles in his trash convince his neighbors that he is a playboy. Baxter earns glowing performance reviews from the four managers, flagging the attention of personnel director Jeff Sheldrake. Sheldrake deduces the real reason, but promises Baxter a promotion in return for a key to his apartment, starting that night. As compensation for such short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to The Music Man and promotes him (Baxter has a personal office now). Baxter asks Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the office building to whom he is attracted, to join him. She explains she already has a date for the evening, but agrees to meet him at the theater before showtime. Her date turns out to be with Sheldrake, whom she had been trysting before breaking it off. When Sheldrake tells her that he plans to divorce his wife to be with her, she agrees to go with him to Baxter's apartment, while Baxter waits forlornly outside the theater. She leaves a compact with a cracked mirror in the apartment, which Baxter then gives to Sheldrake During the company's raucous Christmas Eve party, Baxter is very proud to tell Fran about his promotion until he sees in her hands the pocket mirror, she had left at home and realizes that it is her that Sheldrake is seeing in secret. Baxter doesn't tell Fran what he has realized. Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen tells Fran that her boss has had numerous affairs with office personnel, including herself. Later, Fran confronts Sheldrake at Baxter's apartment. When she gives him a wrapped Christmas present, he gives her a $100 bill from his wallet and tells her to buy herself something expensive. Claiming he loves her, he rushes for the train back to his family in White Plains . Finding out that Fran is the woman Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment, Baxter gets drunk at a local bar. Killing time before he can go home, he allows himself to be picked up by a married woman; they then head back to his apartment. There, he discovers Fran passed out on his bed from an overdose of his sleeping pills. He ditches the woman and enlists his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss, to revive Fran. Baxter implies that he was responsible for the incident; Dreyfuss scolds him for philandering and advises him to \"be a mensch .\" Fran spends two days recuperating in Baxter's apartment, during which a bond develops between them, especially after he confesses to his own suicide attempt over unrequited love back in his hometown of Cincinnati. Fran says that she has always suffered bad luck in her love life. During Fran's stay, one of the managers arrives for a tryst. Baxter persuades him to leave, but the manager recognizes her and later informs his colleagues. Though impressed, they are nonetheless annoyed that they have not had the same ready access to the apartment since Baxter's promotion. When Fran's brother-in-law Karl shows up at the office building looking for her, he is sent to Baxter's apartment, catching him in the middle of preparing a romantic dinner. Baxter deflects Karl's anger over Fran's wayward behavior by once again assuming all responsibility. Karl punches him, prompting Fran to kiss Baxter on the forehead for protecting her. When Sheldrake learns that Miss Olsen has ratted him out to Fran, he fires her. She retaliates by spilling all to his wife, who throws him out. Now free, Sheldrake tries to renew his pursuit of Fran. Having promoted Baxter to Assistant Personnel Director, Sheldrake expects to be lent the key to his apartment yet again. Baxter gives him one — to the building's \"executive washroom\" — proclaiming that he is quitting the firm in favor of becoming a mensch . Back home, he begins to pack his things at his apartment room. That night, at a New Year's Eve party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about Baxter quitting, complaining that Baxter refused to let him use his apartment. Fran abandons Sheldrake and runs to the apartment. At the door, she hears an apparent gunshot, but Baxter opens the door holding a bottle of frothing champagne. Fran retrieves a deck of cards to resume a game of gin rummy they had started earlier. Baxter declares his love for Fran with a tender smile. She replies: “Shut up and deal”.",

During Reed's absence, Bryant falls into a complicated affair with O'Neill. Upon his return, Reed discovers the affair and realizes he still loves Bryant. The two marry secretly and make a home together in Croton-on-Hudson, New York , but still have conflicting desires.

    "plot": "On June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion , incurring major losses against the artillery and machine gun fire of the heavily fortified German forces . Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division , is listed as missing. General George C. Marshall orders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, medic Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks combat experience. The group tracks Ryan to the town of Neuville-au-Plain , where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find scores of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers' dog tags in front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryan's among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone who knows Ryan; one soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle. On the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men prepare to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow the rules of war . Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", ordering that he surrender to the next Allied patrol. Discontented with the mission, Reiben threatens to desert , leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he had always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether his wife will still recognize him after the war. In Ramelle, Miller's detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryan's group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home. Decades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Miller's grave at the Normandy Cemetery . Ryan expresses that he remembers Miller's words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.",

    "plot": "Linguist Louise Banks's daughter Hannah dies at the age of twelve from an incurable illness. Twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft hover over various locations around the Earth . In the ensuing widespread panic, affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them.  In the United States , US Army Colonel Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana . On board, Banks and Donnelly make contact with two cephalopod -like, seven-limbed aliens, whom they call \"heptapods\"; Donnelly nicknames them Abbott and Costello . Banks and Donnelly research the complex written language of the heptapods, consisting of phrases written with logograms , and share the results with other nations. As Banks studies the language, she starts to have flashback-like visions of her daughter. When Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the heptapods have come, they answer with a statement that could be translated as \"offer weapon\". China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting them to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly related to the concepts of \"means\" or \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong , a highly competitive game. Meanwhile, the Russian team receives a message that they translate as \"there is no time,\" which they interpret as a possible threat. Rogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly reenter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them a more complex message. Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks from the vessel, knocking them unconscious. When they wake, the heptapod craft has moved beyond reach and the US military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation. General Shang of China issues an ultimatum to the alien craft in China, demanding that it leave within 24 hours. Russia , Pakistan , and Sudan follow suit; communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in. Donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the 3D space into which it is projected. Banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve craft and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it. Banks goes alone to the Montana craft, which sends down a transport pod. Abbott has been mortally injured as a result of the explosion. Costello explains that they have come to help humanity, because in 3,000 years' time they will need humanity's help in return. Banks realizes the \"weapon\" is their language. Learning the language alters humans' linear perception of time, allowing them to experience memories of future events . Banks's visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions ; her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future. Banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the aliens' language is the \"tool\" that was meant by the word \"weapon\". She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating global unity achieved by deciphering the heptapods' language. At the event, General Shang thanks Banks for persuading him to stop the attack when she called his private number and recited his wife's dying words. [ a ] He then shows her his private number and whispers his wife's words into her ear. In the present, Banks takes CIA agent Halpern's satellite phone from a table and calls Shang's private number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and releasing their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve spacecraft depart. From what she has learned, Banks writes and publishes a book called The Universal Language , a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods. During the evacuation, Donnelly expresses his love for Banks. They talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end.

    "plot": "During the First World War , two French aviators of the Service Aéronautique , the aristocratic Captain de Boëldieu and the working-class Lieutenant Maréchal, set out to investigate a blurred spot found on reconnaissance photographs. They are shot down by German flying ace and aristocrat Rittmeister von Rauffenstein, and both are taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army . Upon returning to the aerodrome , Rauffenstein sends a subordinate to find out if the aviators are officers and, if so, to invite them to lunch. During the meal, Rauffenstein and Boëldieu discover they have mutual acquaintances—a depiction of the familiarity, if not solidarity, within the upper classes that crosses national boundaries. Boëldieu and Maréchal are then taken to a prisoner-of-war camp , where they meet a colorful group of French prisoners and stage a vaudeville -type performance just after the Germans have taken Fort Douaumont in the epic Battle of Verdun . During the performance, word arrives that the French have recaptured the fort. Maréchal interrupts the show, and the French prisoners spontaneously burst into \" La Marseillaise \". As a result of the disruption, Maréchal is placed in solitary confinement, where he suffers badly from lack of human contact and hunger; the fort changes hands once more while he is imprisoned. Boëldieu and Maréchal also help their fellow prisoners to finish digging an escape tunnel. However, just before it is completed, everyone is transferred to other camps. Because of the language barrier, Maréchal is unable to pass word of the tunnel to an incoming British prisoner. Boëldieu and Maréchal are moved from camp to camp, finally arriving in Wintersborn, a mountain fortress prison commanded by Rauffenstein, who has been so badly injured in battle that he has been given a posting away from the front, much to his regret. Rauffenstein tells them that Wintersborn is escape-proof. At Wintersborn, the pair are reunited with a fellow prisoner, Rosenthal, from the original camp. Rosenthal is a wealthy French Jew who generously shares the food parcels he receives.  Boëldieu comes up with an idea, after carefully observing how the German guards respond to an emergency. He volunteers to distract the guards for the few minutes needed for Maréchal and Rosenthal to escape. After a commotion staged by the prisoners, the guards are ordered to assemble them in the fortress courtyard. During the roll call, it is discovered that Boëldieu is missing. He makes his presence known high up in the fortress, drawing the German guards away in pursuit. Maréchal and Rosenthal take the opportunity to lower themselves from a window by a homemade rope and flee. Rauffenstein stops the guards from firing at Boëldieu and pleads with his friend to give himself up.  Boëldieu refuses, and Rauffenstein reluctantly shoots him with his pistol, aiming for his legs but misses and accidentally (and fatally) hits him in the stomach. Nursed in his final moments by a grieving Rauffenstein, Boëldieu laments that the whole purpose of the nobility and their usefulness to both French and German culture is being destroyed by the war. He expresses pity for Rauffenstein, who will have to find a new purpose in the postwar world. Maréchal and Rosenthal journey across the German countryside, trying to reach neutral Switzerland. Rosenthal injures his foot, slowing Maréchal down. They quarrel and part, but then Maréchal returns to help his comrade. They take refuge in the modest farmhouse of a German woman, Elsa, who lost her husband at Verdun , along with three brothers, at battles which, with quiet irony, she describes as \"our greatest victories\". She takes them in and does not betray them to a passing army patrol. She and Maréchal fall in love, despite not speaking each other's language, but he and Rosenthal eventually leave from a sense of duty after Rosenthal recovers from his injury. Maréchal declares he will come back to Elsa and her young daughter, Lotte, if he survives the war. A German patrol sights the two fugitives crossing a snow-covered valley. They fire a few rounds, but their commanding officer, hurrying to the scene, orders them to stop, saying the pair have crossed into Switzerland.",

    "plot": "The film is set in the year 1900, during the Belle Époque at the turn of the 20th century. While in the Bois de Boulogne , Honoré Lachaille remarks that in Paris, marriage is not the sole option for wealthy young bon vivants like his nephew Gaston, who is bored with life. Gaston does enjoy spending time with Madame Alvarez and her granddaughter, precocious, carefree Gilberte, affectionately known as Gigi. Gigi's mother (a singer who is heard but never seen onscreen) leaves her care mostly to Madame Alvarez. Following the \"family tradition\", Madame Alvarez regularly sends Gigi to her sister and Gigi's great-aunt, Alicia, to be groomed as a courtesan , a kept mistress of wealthy men. Gigi learns proper etiquette and charm but disdains the trivial love between a man and his mistress. She prefers to have fun with Gaston, whom she regards as an older brother or a young uncle. Like his uncle, Gaston is a known wealthy womanizer in Parisian high society. When his latest mistress has an affair with her ice-skating instructor, Gaston publicly humiliates her, resulting in her fake attempted suicide. Gaston plans to retreat to the country, but his uncle insists that he remain in Paris and attend even more parties. While playing cards with Gaston, Gigi wagers that if he loses, he must take her and her grandmother to the seaside for the weekend. Gaston loses the bet, and the three travel to Trouville . While Gaston and Gigi have fun together, Honoré and Madame Alvarez unexpectedly reunite and reminisce about their once-passionate affair. When Gaston goes to Monte Carlo, Great-Aunt Alicia and Madame Alvarez scheme to turn Gigi into Gaston's mistress. Though initially dubious, Madame Alvarez agrees to Gigi being intensively trained before Gaston's return. Gigi accepts this as pre-destined. When Gaston returns, he is discomfited when Gigi shows off her new womanly gown. Gaston insults the dress, preferring her juvenile outfits; Gigi mocks his taste in clothes. Offended, Gaston storms out, then realizes his folly and returns to apologize. He offers to take Gigi to tea at the Reservoir, but Madame Alvarez tells him that an unchaperoned Gigi being seen in public with him could damage her reputation. Angered, Gaston storms out again. He reflects on Gigi, realizing he has developed a romantic desire for her. Although hesitant due to her young age, Gaston realizes that he loves Gigi. He proposes a generous \"business arrangement\" to Madame Alvarez and Aunt Alicia for Gigi to become his mistress. Gigi refuses, telling Gaston she does not seek celebrity status, only to eventually be abandoned by him and become another man's mistress. She wants their relationship to remain platonic, but when Gaston reveals that he is in love with her, Gigi is horrified. She calls Gaston a wicked man for claiming to love her while still proposing this arrangement before fleeing the room in tears. Gaston chastises Madame Alvarez for exposing Gigi to the sordid details of his lifestyle, then leaves. Gigi later sends for Gaston and tells him that she would rather be miserable with him than without him, agreeing to the arrangement. The couple go to Maxim's restaurant. Gigi performs perfectly as his courtesan, which upsets Gaston. He is disturbed by Gigi's knowledge of society gossip. After presenting her with an expensive emerald bracelet, he grows increasingly uncomfortable with the unrelenting scrutiny being heaped on them. Honoré congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and remarks that Gigi is so delightful that she will likely keep him amused for months. Gaston is so disgusted by his uncle's remark, he drags Gigi from the restaurant all the way back home without saying a word while she cries and protests, not understanding what is wrong. After returning Gigi home in tears, he wanders the dark streets of Paris in silence, only to finally return and asks Madame Alvarez for Gigi's hand in marriage. The final sequence returns to Honoré Lachaille, who proudly points out Gaston and Gigi getting into a carriage in the Bois de Boulogne : elegant, beautiful, and happily married.",

The company is opening the season with Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake . After forcing the current prima ballerina , Beth, into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer for the dual roles of the innocent and fragile White Swan, Odette, and the sensual and dark Black Swan, Odile. Nina auditions and gives a flawless performance as Odette, but fails to embody Odile, causing Thomas to dismiss her. The next day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider. He forcibly kisses her and she bites him and runs out of his office. Later, Nina is surprised to find she has received the lead role. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth publicly accuses Nina of providing sexual favors to Thomas in return for the role. The next day, Nina hears Beth had been hit by a car; Thomas believes she was attempting suicide . Nina visits Beth in the hospital and is distraught to see her injured legs; it is clear she will never dance again. During rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe a newcomer, Lily, who has a physical resemblance to Nina but also an uninhibited quality Nina lacks. Nina has hallucinations and finds scratch marks on her back. One night, despite Erica's objections, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to go out for drinks. Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule, which Nina reluctantly accepts. While intoxicated, Nina flirts with men at the bar and Lily as well. After the two dance at a nightclub , they go back to Nina's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Nina wakes up disoriented and alone and realizes that she is late for rehearsal. At rehearsal, Nina sees Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about their sexual encounter. Lily denies that it happened and mocks Nina for fantasizing about her. Nina becomes convinced Lily intends to replace her, especially after learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate. Nina's mysterious injuries and hallucinations grow more severe, leading to an incident where she believes she is transforming into Odile. Erica grows concerned about her well-being and attempts to prevent Nina from performing on opening night. After a physical confrontation with her mother and a confrontation with Beth, Nina arrives at the theater, where she finds Lily preparing to take the stage as Odette because Nina has been absent.

Nina returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing to play Odile. She confronts her and Lily appears to transform into a doppelgänger of Nina. The two fight, breaking a mirror. Nina stabs her doppelgänger with a shard of glass, killing her and breaking the illusion. Nina hides Lily's body and takes the stage. She dances flawlessly as Odile and seemingly begins to turn into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss. In her dressing room, Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, but is interrupted by Lily, who congratulates Nina for her performance. Nina sees the mirror is still broken, but all other evidence of the stabbing is gone, including the body. She looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she stabbed herself and not Lily. Despite her injury, she dances the final act of the ballet with blood gradually seeping through her costume. The show ends with her jumping from the set onto a hidden mattress to simulate Odette throwing herself off a cliff. Everyone erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the other dancers gather to congratulate Nina backstage. Thomas eventually realizes Nina is bleeding and shouts for help, asking Nina what happened. Nina calmly replies: \"I felt it. Perfect. It was perfect\", as the screen fades to white.",

    "plot": "In coastal Camden, Maine , Matt and Ruth Fowler enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank, a recent college graduate home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with a divorced older woman with children, Natalie Strout; Ruth is concerned about the relationship, while Matt thinks it is only a fling. The family struggles to communicate their feelings to one another, especially regarding Frank's relationship and schooling. Frank is about to begin graduate school for architecture but is considering staying in town to continue working as a fisherman and to be near Natalie and her kids. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout, tries to find a way into his ex-wife and children's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie, including assaulting Frank. Frank rushes to Natalie's home one evening after receiving a frightened phone call from one of her children. He arrives to find the living room trashed and Natalie in distress. She tells him Richard just left, but he returns almost immediately. Natalie takes the boys upstairs, and Frank insists through the locked front door that Richard leave. He feigns doing so, only to break in through the back door with a handgun; in the ensuing scuffle, Frank is shot and killed. Though equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways, with Matt putting on a brave face and quickly returning to work, while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. The couple retreat with friends Willis and Katie Grinnel to a secluded cottage for a weekend, but Ruth is distant and Matt begins to drink heavily. At Richard's bail hearing, Natalie is pressed by his lawyer over whether she saw the shooting, as she initially testified when police arrived on the scene, and she tearfully shakes her head, as she only heard what happened. The tension between Matt and Ruth increases when their lawyer informs them that because of the change from Natalie's original testimony, Richard was allowed out on bail, and his defense will argue that Frank's death was an accident, meaning Richard will most likely be charged with accidental manslaughter and only serve five to ten years in prison. The couple begin to see Richard around town. Matt approaches Natalie at work to check in on her and the two have a well-intentioned but strained conversation. Matt takes the boat out to catch lobsters to feel a connection with Frank, but he struggles with it and is pinched by a lobster, leaving a bleeding wound on one finger which Matt bandages. Natalie approaches Ruth at work and attempts to apologize, but Ruth slaps her before dismissively returning to her work. Natalie leaves in tears. Later that day, Ruth runs into Richard at the grocery store. When she returns home, an argument erupts between the couple in which they emotionally savage each other; Matt lambastes Ruth for being overbearing in Frank's youth, while Ruth chastises Matt for showing little grief for their deceased son and encouraging his relationship with Natalie because of his own vicarious lust for her. After a young girl selling candy for a fundraiser interrupts them, Matt takes back what he said to Ruth, who apologizes in turn and, breaking down, tells Matt about seeing Natalie and Richard. They embrace and find common ground in their grief. Matt and Willis spend the evening drinking and lamenting the injustice, and Willis asks if the couple have considered moving or doing anything about Richard. Matt abducts Richard at gunpoint, saying he's arranged for Richard to jump bail and leave the state, so as to spare them the pain of seeing him in Camden. He forces Richard to pack clothes for warm weather and plants a train schedule in his apartment. He then makes Richard drive them to the Grinnel cabin, where Willis is waiting with another vehicle. He begins to load Richard's belongings, but Matt hesitates, then shoots Richard, killing him. Willis admonishes Matt for not following their plan to kill Richard in the woods, and Matt responds that he couldn't wait. They bury Richard's body deep in the woods but are stuck unexpectedly at a bridge crossing on their return home. Willis laments that this cost them nearly an hour, meaning they will arrive back in town just after sunrise instead of in darkness. Matt returns home to find Ruth awake. She asks, \"Did you do it?\" Matt appears troubled and unresponsive. He climbs into bed and turns away from her. She asks if he's okay, and Matt haltingly describes a photo he saw in Richard's apartment of him with Natalie in a loving embrace, but cannot explain why it affected him. At length Ruth gets up to make coffee, calling \"Matt, do you want coffee?\" from the kitchen, but he doesn't answer. Matt removes the bandage from his finger and finds the wound scabbed over.",

At the time of issuance of said order, the planes, flying B-52 bombers armed with thermonuclear bombs , are on airborne alert two hours from their targets inside the Soviet Union . The aircraft commence attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their CRM 114 discriminators , which are designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Happening upon a radio that had been missed earlier and hearing regular civilian broadcasting, Mandrake realizes that no attack order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been fluoridating American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids \" of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has gone completely mad. In the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how \"Plan R\" enables a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets if all of his superior officers have been killed in a first strike on the United States. Trying every CRM code combination to issue a recall order would require two days, so Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson, noting the slim odds of recalling the planes in time, then proposes that Muffley not only let the attack proceed but send reinforcements. Muffley rejects Turgidson's recommendation and instead brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov. Muffley warns the premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the targets, flight plans, and defensive systems of the bombers so that the Soviets can protect themselves. After a heated discussion with a drunken Kissov, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union created a doomsday machine as a nuclear deterrent ; it consists of many buried cobalt bombs , which are set to detonate automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The resulting nuclear fallout would render the Earth's surface uninhabitable for 93 years. The device cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. The president's German scientific adviser, the paraplegic former Nazi Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only have been an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it; de Sadeski replies that Kissov had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week at the Party Congress . When the U.S. Army troops gain control of Burpelson, General Ripper commits suicide. Mandrake infers the CRM code from doodles on Ripper's desk blotter and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, Strategic Air Command successfully recalls all of the bombers except for one, commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong. Because its radio equipment was damaged by a Soviet SAM , it is unable to receive or send communications. To conserve fuel, Kong flies below radar and switches targets, thus preventing Soviet air radar from detecting and intercepting their plane. Because the Soviet missile also damaged the bomb bay doors, Kong enters the bay and repairs the electrical wiring. When he is successful, the bomb drops with him straddling it. Kong joyously hoots and waves his cowboy hat as he rides the falling bomb to his death. In the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. Worried that the Soviets will do the same, Turgidson warns about a \"mineshaft gap\" (spoofing the term \" missile gap \") while de Sadeski secretly photographs the War Room. Dr. Strangelove prepares to announce his plan for that when he suddenly stands up out of his wheelchair and exclaims, \" Mein Führer , I can walk!\" The movie ends with a montage of explosions set to \" We'll Meet Again \" signifying the activation of the doomsday device.",

    "plot": "In 1945, the don of New York City 's Corleone family , Vito Corleone , listens to requests during his daughter Connie 's wedding to Carlo Rizzi . Vito's youngest son Michael , a Marine and World War II hero who has so far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend Kay Adams to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson , seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere , Tom Hagen , to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed. As Christmas approaches, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business to provide police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, hitmen gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey, on Sollozzo's payroll, orders NYPD police officers to clear out Vito's guards. Michael stops the attempt on his father's life but is then beaten up by Captain McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. The Corleones agree to the meeting and devise a plan to plant a handgun in the bathroom of the Bronx restaurant where the meeting will be held. Michael speaks with Sollozzo for several minutes then excuses himself, retrieves the gun, and shoots both men dead. Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge under the protection of Don Tommasino in Sicily , and Vito's second son Fredo is sheltered by Jewish mobster Moe Greene in Las Vegas . In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia . Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. Apollonia is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for Michael. Devastated by Sonny's death and tired of war as the capo dei capi , Vito sets up a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. They have two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito tells Michael that he now knows that their true adversary had been Don Barzini all along. He warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo . With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Moe Greene's stake in the family's casinos and reprimands Fredo for defending Greene, whom Barzini had turned against the family. In 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's son Anthony . At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. Michael, remembering his father's warning, deduces the plot and Tessio is led off to be murdered. While Michael stands at the baptismal font as the child's godfather , Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the four other families as well as Greene for not selling his hotel. Michael extracts Carlo's confession that he had conspired with Barzini on Sonny's assassination. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered. However, Clemenza strangles Carlo in a car shortly afterwards. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if he ordered Carlo's death, which Michael denies, leaving Kay relieved. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\".",

Frank assaults Randy for repeatedly calling Charlie \"Chuck\", a name Charlie despises, revealing his growing affection for Charlie. As they return to NYC, Charlie mentions his problem at school. Frank advises he turn informant, warning that George will probably submit to Trask's pressure, so he should act first so he can attend Harvard.

The plaintiffs , Kaye's sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care. A Catholic diocese representative offers Galvin $210,000 (equivalent to $561,000 in 2023 [ 5 ] ). Deeply affected by seeing Kaye, Galvin declines and states his intention to try the case, stunning the defendants and the judge . While preparing for trial, Galvin encounters divorcée Laura Fischer in a bar, and they become romantically involved. Galvin experiences several setbacks. His medical expert disappears, and a hastily arranged substitute's credentials are challenged. Nobody who was in the delivery room is willing to testify that negligence occurred.

Kaye's brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannon's team tells him of the settlement offer that Galvin rejected. In chambers, Judge Hoyle has a heated exchange with Galvin and threatens him with disbarment . Galvin dismisses Hoyle as a \" Bag Man \" for the local political machine and \"a defendant 's judge\" who \"couldn't hack it\" as a lawyer. Hoyle denies Galvin's motion for a mistrial and threatens to have him arrested. Galvin storms out. Galvin notices that Kaye's admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello, filled out a form which included the question, \"When did you last eat?\" Galvin tracks down Costello in New York City and travels there to request her testimony. While Laura arranges to meet Galvin in New York, Morrissey finds a check from Concannon in her handbag and realizes she is Concannon's spy. Morrissey also travels to New York and informs Galvin of Laura's betrayal. Galvin confronts her in a bar and strikes her, knocking her to the floor. On the flight back to Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannon's ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue the trial. In her courtroom testimony, Costello says she wrote on the admitting form that Kaye ate a full meal one hour before arriving at the hospital. On cross-examination, an incredulous Concannon asks how she can prove this. Costello reveals that her superiors coerced her into changing the form from \"1\" to \"9\", but before doing so, she made a photocopy which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original document is presumed to be correct; however, Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello further testifies that the anesthesiologist later confessed he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia, which is dangerous for someone who ate only one hour prior. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costello's career unless she changed the form. After Costello's testimony, Concannon again objects on the grounds that the original admitting document has precedence. Hoyle agrees and declares Costello's testimony stricken from the record . Afterward, a diocese lawyer praises Concannon's performance to the bishop, who asks \"Did you believe her?\", and is met with embarrassed silence. Despite feeling his case is hopeless, Galvin gives an impassioned closing argument . The jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs, and the foreman asks whether the jury can award more than what was sought. Hoyle resignedly replies they can.

    "name": "The Big Short",
    "plot": "The film consists of three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis . In 2005, eccentric hedge fund manager Michael Burry discovers that the United States housing market , based on high-risk subprime loans , is extremely unstable . Anticipating the market's collapse in the second quarter of 2007, as interest rates would rise from adjustable-rate mortgages , he proposes to create a credit default swap (CDS) market for mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), allowing him to bet against, or short , MBSs for profit. His long-term bet, exceeding $1 billion, is accepted by major investment and commercial banks but requires paying substantial monthly premiums . This sparks his main client, Lawrence Fields, to accuse him of \"wasting\" capital while many clients demand that he reverse and sell, but Burry refuses. Under pressure, he eventually restricts withdrawals, angering investors, and Fields sues Burry. Eventually, the 2008 financial crisis began and his fund's value increases by 489% with an overall profit (even allowing for the massive premiums) of over $2.69 billion, with Fields alone receiving $489 million. Jared Vennett (based on Greg Lippmann ), [ 7 ] the executive in charge of global asset-backed securities trading at Deutsche Bank , [ 8 ] is one of the first bankers to understand Burry's analysis, learning from one of the bankers who sold Burry an early CDS. Using his quant to verify that Burry is most likely correct, he decides to enter the market and purchase CDSs himself. However, his large monthly premiums result in him looking to reduce the size of his position by selling CDSs. A misplaced phone call alerts FrontPoint Partners hedge fund manager Mark Baum (based on Steve Eisman ), who is motivated to buy swaps from Vennett due to his low regard for banks' ethics and business models. Vennett explains that the packaging of subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) rated AAA will guarantee their eventual collapse. Conducting a field investigation in South Florida, the FrontPoint team discovers that mortgage brokers are profiting by selling their mortgage deals to Wall Street banks, which pay higher margins for the riskier mortgages, creating the bubble. This knowledge prompts the FrontPoint team to buy CDSs from Vennett. In early 2007, as these loans begin to default, CDO prices somehow rise and ratings agencies refuse to downgrade the bond ratings. Baum discovers conflicts of interest and dishonesty amongst the credit rating agencies from an acquaintance at Standard & Poor's . Vennett invites the team to the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas, where Baum learns from a CDO manager that the market for insuring mortgage bonds, including \" synthetic CDOs \" which are bets in favor of the faulty mortgage bonds, is significantly larger than the market for the mortgage loans themselves, leading a horrified Baum to realize the entire world economy is set to collapse. As the subprime bonds continue to fall, Baum learns that Morgan Stanley , under whose umbrella FrontPoint operates, had also taken short positions against mortgage derivatives . However, in order to offset the risk and the monthly premiums, it had sold short positions in higher-rated mortgage derivatives. Now that these are also collapsing in value, Morgan Stanley is facing severe liquidity problems. Despite pressure from his staff to sell their position before Morgan Stanley collapses, Baum refuses to sell until the economy is on the verge of collapsing, making over $1 billion in their CDSs. Even so, Baum laments that the banks, as well as the government, will not admit what caused the economy to collapse, but will instead blame \"immigrants and poor people.\" Young investors Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley run a small firm called Brownfield Fund (based on the firm Cornwall Capital ). They accidentally discover a marketing presentation by Vennett on a coffee table in the lobby of JPMorgan Chase (the characters address the audience stating that in reality they had heard about Vennett's plan through word-of-mouth from friends and publications), convincing them to invest in CDSs (the insurance against CDOs), as it fits their strategy of buying cheap insurance with big potential payouts. Below the capital threshold for an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement required to enter into trades like Burry's and Baum's, they enlist the aid of Ben Rickert, Shipley's neighbor and a retired securities trader who was based in Singapore . When the bond values and CDOs rise despite defaults, Geller suspects the banks of committing fraud. The trio also visit the American Securitization Forum, where they learn that the SEC has no regulations to monitor mortgage-backed security activity. They successfully make profit by shorting the higher-rated AA mortgage securities, as they were considered highly stable and carried a much higher payout ratio. Later, as home mortgage defaults increase, the price of their CDSs does not rise nor does the price of the underlying mortgage bonds drop, and they realize the banks and the ratings agencies are secretly freezing the price of their CDOs in order to sell and short them before the inevitable crash. Outraged at the bank's cheating, Geller and Shipley try to tip off the press about the upcoming disaster and the rampant fraud, but a reporter from The Wall Street Journal whom they have known since college and regard as principled declines to report the story in the interest of preserving his relationships with Wall Street investment banks. As the market starts collapsing, Ben, on vacation in England, sells their CDSs. Ultimately, they turn their $30 million investment into $80 million, but their faith in the system is broken when Ben tells them of the severe consequences for the general public. Jared Vennett receives a bonus of $47 million for profits made on his CDSs. Mark Baum becomes more gracious from the financial fallout, and his staff continue to operate their fund. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley go their separate ways after unsuccessfully trying to sue the ratings agencies, with Jamie still running the fund and Charlie moving to Charlotte to start a family. Ben Rickert returns to his peaceful retirement. Michael Burry closes his fund after public backlash and multiple IRS audits , now investing only in water securities. The personnel of the banks responsible for the crisis escape any consequences for their actions, with the single exception of one trader, Kareem Serageldin . It is noted that as of 2015, banks are selling CDOs again under a new label: \" Bespoke Tranche Opportunity \".",

    "plot": "In 1941, Austrian SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite about a fugitive Jewish family, the Dreyfuses. He boasts his nickname, \"The Jew Hunter,\" then offers LaPadite amnesty if he will give up the Dreyfuses. LaPadite tearfully admits that they are hiding under his floor. Landa's men massacre the Dreyfuses, but one of them, young Shosanna, escapes unharmed. Three years later, U.S. Army lieutenant Aldo Raine recruits Jewish-American soldiers to the \"Basterds,\" a black ops commando unit tasked with instilling fear among Nazis in occupied France by killing and scalping them. The group includes Sergeant Donny \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz, privates first class Smithson Utivich and Omar Ulmer, rogue German sergeant Hugo Stiglitz, and Austrian-born translator Corporal Wilhelm Wicki. Raine leaves a swastika mark on surviving German soldiers so they can't hide their Nazi affiliations after the war. Shosanna now operates a cinema in Paris under the name Emmanuelle Mimieux and meets Fredrick Zoller, a famed German sniper set to star in the German propaganda film Stolz der Nation ( Nation's Pride ). Infatuated with \"Emmanuelle,\" Zoller convinces Joseph Goebbels to hold the film's premiere at her cinema. Landa, the premiere's head of security, interrogates Shosanna but doesn't reveal if he recognizes her. She plots with her Afro-French lover and projectionist, Marcel, to kill the German leaders by burning down the cinema with her collection of highly flammable nitrate films . British Commando Lieutenant Archie Hicox, a former film critic and fluent German speaker, is recruited for Operation Kino, an attack on the premiere with the Basterds. Disguised as German officers, Hicox, Stiglitz, and Wicki meet with German film star Bridget von Hammersmark, an undercover Allied agent, in an occupied town at a tavern unexpectedly full of German soldiers. Hicox's unusual accent arouses suspicion from Wehrmacht sergeant Wilhelm and SS Sturmbannfühurer Dieter Hellström, who joins Hicox's group when his suspicions are aroused. Hicox and Hammersmark convince him they are genuine, but Hicox blows their cover with a non-German hand gesture. Everyone is killed in the ensuing gunfight except Wilhelm and a wounded von Hammersmark. Raine negotiates with Wilhelm for von Hammersmark's release until she shoots Wilhelm dead. Believing she set his men up, Raine tortures von Hammersmark, but she convinces him of her loyalty and reveals Hitler is attending the premiere. Raine decides the mission needs to go ahead with himself, Donowitz, and Ulmer to attend posing as Italian filmmakers. Von Hanmersmark is doubtful but thinks the Germans won't find their Italian accents suspicious. Landa investigates the tavern and finds von Hammersmark's shoe and a napkin with her signature. The Basterds infiltrate the premiere with timed explosives. Landa, fluent in Italian, sees through their cover and confronts von Hammersmark privately, strangling her to death. He has Raine arrested along with Utivich, whom he has also detected, but leaves Ulmer and Donowitz in the theater. Taking advantage of the situation, Landa offers to let the attack proceed if Raine's OSS commanders will guarantee his safety after the war. Raine contacts his commanders, and Landa negotiates a generous deal for himself and his radio operator. During the screening, Zoller confronts Shosanna in the projection booth, and they shoot each other dead. As Nation's Pride reaches its climax, Shosanna's face appears on the screen telling the Nazi audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Having locked the auditorium, Marcel ignites a pile of nitrate film behind the screen, setting the theater ablaze. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the opera box, gun down Hitler and Goebbels, and fire into the panicked crowd until the explosives demolish the cinema. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender to Raine.

Owner Enzo Ferrari uses Ford's offer to secure a deal with Fiat that allows him to retain ownership of the firm's racing team, Scuderia Ferrari , and insults Ford and his whole company. This leads Ford into ordering his racing division to build a car to compete against Ferrari at Le Mans and Iacocca hiring Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby , a retired driver who won Le Mans in 1959 . Shelby enlists his friend Ken Miles , a hot-tempered English racing driver and mechanical engineer. Shelby and Miles develop the UK-built Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles International Airport while the latter gives advice on how to enhance the car's performance. At the launch of the new Ford Mustang , Miles gives a witheringly rude appraisal of it to Ford senior vice president Leo Beebe. Beebe campaigns against sending Miles to the upcoming race at Le Mans as a public relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sends Phil Hill and Bruce McLaren to Le Mans; none of the Fords finish. Miles, who is listening on radio, realizes that he was right on all the car's flaws. When Ford demands why he should not sack Shelby, Shelby explains that despite the GT40's reliability problems, it instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari by reaching 218 mph (350.8 km/h ) on the Mulsanne Straight before breaking down. He says a race car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him to continue the project and report directly to him. During testing of the GT40 Mk II , the recurrent problem of brake fade causes a crash and fire, which Miles survives. The team realizes the rules permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race. In 1966, Beebe takes over the racing division. When he and Ford arrive to inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in the GT40. Shelby makes an agreement with Ford: if Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona , then he will race at Le Mans. If not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American. At Daytona International Speedway , Beebe enters a second GT40 supported by a NASCAR team with quicker pit stops. However, Shelby clears Miles to push his car beyond the 7,000 RPM redline, and he wins. At the next race at Le Mans , Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap. The pit crew fixes it, and Miles sets lap records, catching the Ferraris. The GT40 suffers brake fade while dicing with the prototype 330 P3 Ferrari of Lorenzo Bandini , so Miles limps into the pits for replacement of the entire braking system. Ferrari protests, but Shelby assures race officials it is legal. Miles and Bandini duel on the Mulsanne Straight until the Ferrari breaks down, putting Bandini out of the race. With Fords in the top three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other Fords to catch him and give the press a three-car photo finish . Shelby tells Miles what Beebe wants but says it is Miles's call. Miles initially continues to set new lap records but decides to comply on the final lap. McLaren is declared the winner as, having started behind Miles, his car traveled farther overall. Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the win, but an unusually sanguine Miles lets it pass, saying to Shelby, \"You promised me the drive, not the win.\" From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track. As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time. Two months later, Miles is killed in a crash while testing the J-car at Riverside International Raceway . Six months later, Shelby parks outside Miles's widow Mollie's house and hesitates. Miles's son Peter arrives, and the two talk about Miles. Shelby gives Peter a wrench that Miles once threw at him in anger. A textual epilogue reveals that Ford continued its Le Mans winning streak in 1967 , 1968 , and 1969 , and Miles was posthumously inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001.",

Parris is both friends with and is drawn to Cassandra whom the other children avoid because her family is \"strange\". They play together regularly. The boys are best friends and Randy plays with them sometimes. When Dr. Tower takes Cassie out of school and she is confined at home, Parris does not see her for many years. He finally meets her again when she opens the door for him to begin his medical studies under Dr. Tower's tutelage. [ 6 ] However, she is very hesitant and says almost nothing. The next morning, Parris' best friend, Drake, says that he intends to marry Louise who is in love with him as well despite the disapproval of her father, Dr. Gordon. Louise, however, refuses to defy her parents and will not marry him. As Parris continues his studies with Dr. Tower, he and Cassie begin a secret romance, seeing each other at Drake’s house. But he and Dr. Tower have a good relationship as well. Dr. Tower has interested Parris in psychiatry which he intends to study in Vienna. Parris' grandmother becomes ill from cancer and dies as he is about to go overseas for medical school.  Parris wants to marry Cassie after he returns from his training. One night Cassie comes desperately to him, begging him to take her with him. When Parris hesitates, she runs back home. The next morning, Drake learns that Dr. Tower has poisoned Cassie and shot himself and has left his entire estate to Parris. Parris finds Dr. Tower's notebook which showed that he killed Cassie because he believed he saw early signs that she might go insane like her mother and he wanted to prevent Parris from ruining his life by marrying her, just as Tower's life had been ruined by marrying Cassie's mother. While Parris is in Vienna, Drake begins to court Randy. Drake's trust fund is stolen by a dishonest bank president and he is forced into a menial position with the railroad. His legs are injured in an accident and amputated by Dr. Gordon.\nDrake and Randy marry but he is embittered by the loss of his legs and refuses to leave his bed.\nParris exchanges letters with Randy and tells her how she might best support Drake emotionally.\nParris allows them to move into the Towers' estate. They decide to borrow money and start a business building houses for working families. Parris returns from Vienna to Kings Row to see Drake.\nBut when Parris suggests they build a home in their own development away from the railroad tracks and the sounds of the trains that plague Drake, Drake becomes hysterical and makes Randy swear to never make him leave the room. When Parris learns that Dr. Gordon has died, leaving the town with no doctor, he decides to stay in Kings Row.  Louise reveals that her father amputated Drake's legs because he hated Drake and thought it was his duty to \"punish wickedness\" which would prevent him from ever marrying his daughter. Parris at first wishes to withhold the truth from Drake, fearing it will destroy his fragile recovery. He considers confining Louise to a mental institution (even though she's not insane) to prevent her and the community learning the truth. When out walking, he sees what appears to be an apparition of Cassie by the pond the two of them used to go to. It is Elise who has moved into his childhood home with her father. Parris grows close to them both and discusses the problem regarding Louise with Elise. She persuades him to treat Drake like any other patient rather than his best friend. Parris frees Louise to reveal all she knows and tells Drake what happened and why. Drake reacts with laughter and defiance, summoning a renewed will to live. Clear of conscience and reinvigorated as a fledgling psychiatrist, Parris rushes to his former home and into Elise’s arms.",

    "obfuscated_plot": "In a small midwestern town in the 1890s, five children grow up together: a polite, clever little boy who lives with his grandmother; a pretty blonde girl, daughter of a secretive doctor and a mother seen only through an upstairs window; an orphaned but wealthy and fun-loving boy who is best friends with the first boy; a daughter of the town physician; and a tomboy from the wrong side of the tracks, whose father is a railroad worker. The clever boy is both friends with and drawn to the blonde girl whom the other children avoid because her family is \"strange\".

    "name": "Dallas Buyers Club",
    "plot": "In 1985, promiscuous Dallas electrician and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and told that he has about 30 days to live. At first, he refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an intravenous drug user. Woodroof's family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from gay sex. He is fired from his job and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an antiretroviral drug called zidovudine (AZT)—the only drug yet approved for testing in human clinical trials by the FDA —is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Saks informs him that half of the trial patients receive the drug and the other half a placebo since this is the only way to determine if the drug works. Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT, which, exacerbated by his cocaine and alcohol abuse, causes his health to deteriorate. Recuperating in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug-addicted, HIV-positive trans woman he is initially hostile toward. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose medical license was revoked because his work with people with AIDS had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is \"poisonous.\" Instead, he prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on ddC and the protein peptide T , which are not yet approved for use in the United States by the FDA. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get the drugs over the border by masquerading as a priest with cancer and claiming they are for personal use. Dr. Saks starts to notice the adverse effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued. Woodroof starts selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at gay nightclubs , and discotheque bars. He reluctantly partners with Rayon since she can bring in more customers. The pair establishes the Dallas Buyers Club, charging $400 per month for membership and giving away the drugs to members to circumvent the laws that made it illegal to sell the drugs. The club is extremely popular, and Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof is hospitalized for a heart attack caused by an overdose of recently acquired interferon from Japan, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and its alternative drugs and is angry that the buyers club is interfering with his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to clubs for HIV drugs but feels powerless to change anything. The process the FDA uses to research, test, and approve drugs is considered flawed and part of the problem for people suffering from AIDS. At that time, the United States and the FDA were particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving anti-AIDS drugs. They were hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband. [ 4 ] Dr. Saks and Woodroof begin a friendship. The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. The FDA changes its regulations in 1987, making any unapproved drug illegal. With the club strapped for cash, Rayon begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico to get more peptide T. Upon his return, he finds that Rayon has died in the hospital and is extremely upset by her death. Dr. Saks is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been sending patients to the buyers club, but she refuses and insists they will have to fire her instead. After Rayon's death, Woodroof begins to show more compassion toward LGBT members of the club, and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority becomes providing the drugs as peptide T gets increasingly challenging to acquire. Woodroof files a lawsuit against the FDA in late 1987, seeking the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as nontoxic but is still not FDA-approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA but lacks the power to do anything. The FDA later allows Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use. He dies of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially had predicted.",

U.S. Marine Corps Major Geoffrey Caton departs Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii aboard the Pan American Clipper to take command on Wake Island where he clashes with a military contractor named McClosky. When Caton's inspection identifies Privates Randall and Doyle as troublemakers, he has them dig a large slit trench by hand. McClosky has a construction contract for large trenches and living quarters, and drives his crew to complete the work on time. There are numerous conflicts between the military and the civilians, including practicing for air raids . On Sunday, December 7, 1941, Randall's enlistment is up. As he prepares to board the Clipper news arrives about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Wake Island is placed on alert and Randall, unsure what to do, goes to a bomb shelter with the civilians as enemy planes approach. Four American are sent against 24 Japanese bombers, downing several but unable to prevent heavy bomb damage on the ground. Following the raid, Caton tells Randall he is no longer a civilian. McClosky stays to dig trenches and other shelters with his heavy equipment. Caton informs pilot Lieutenant Bruce Cameron that his wife was killed at Pearl Harbor. When enemy ships approach the Marines camouflage their equipment and Caton orders them to hold their fire during the Japanese naval bombardment.

    "plot": "On October 25, 1958, at a gathering entitled 'A Salute to Edward R Murrow ', Ed Murrow delivers a speech where he mentions Senator McCarthy among others. The film then reverts to October 14, 1953, in the CBS Studios, with on-screen titles explaining that McCarthy has claimed that there are over 200 Communists in the US government. Fred Friendly and the news team discuss the latest news stories for the forthcoming episodes, and Murrow declares that he wants to go after the American military, who have tried and convicted a member of the Air Force, Milo Radulovich , because his sister and father have been accused of being communist sympathizers. Murrow mentions that the charges against Radulovich were in a sealed envelope and that nobody saw them, suggesting that they investigate the story to see if it is worth covering. Five days later Friendly, Murrow, and Sig Mickelson , CBS director, watch footage of CBS correspondent Joseph Wershba interviewing Milo Radulovich; Mickelson criticizes the report as being unbalanced and accuses the reporter of editorializing. Military men come to Friendly's office, attempting to persuade him not to broadcast the story, but CBS goes ahead and the segment features on Murrow's show See It Now . The focus of the news team shifts to going after McCarthy himself. In one clip, McCarthy accuses a man who was provided with an attorney by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1932 of being a communist. During the segment on McCarthy, Murrow personally invites the Senator on the show to defend the claims made about his corrupt influence. As the story continues, Murrow challenges McCarthy's questioning techniques, and the untruths he espouses in his hearings. Murrow notes that the ACLU is not on the list that McCarthy claims it to be, and that it has in fact been commended by several U.S. presidents. Shirley reads out mostly favorable reports from the newspaper, but one journalist, O'Brian, accuses Hollenbeck, a CBS journalist, of being a \"pinko\", meaning a communist sympathizer. The team is informed that the Air Force has reinstated the wrongfully terminated Radulovich. McCarthy appears on the show on April 6, 1954, and addresses the camera directly without interruption, accusing Murrow of being a communist, something that Murrow suspected would happen. In the proceeding show, Murrow gives his response, where he unequivocally denies the accusation that he was a member of the Communist party and highlights that anyone who criticizes or opposes Senator McCarthy's methods is accused of being a communist. From this point on, the tide turns on McCarthy and he himself is investigated, due to charges the Army has made against him and his Operation. John Aaron later announces this in the newsroom, but the celebration is cut short when a phone call to Friendly informs the news team that Hollenbeck has committed suicide by gassing himself. Footage is shown of the Army–McCarthy hearings , where Joseph Welch , the Army's special counsel, questions McCarthy's sense of decency. Shortly after, CBS chief executive Paley speaks with Murrow and Friendly in his office and tells them they have lost one of their major sponsors, and as a result, he will only give them five more one-hour episodes and also move their slot from Tuesday night to Sunday afternoon. Paley speaks to Friendly privately and informs him that he needs to fire some people. At the same time, Mickelson calls Wershba and Shirley to his office: He knows they are secretly married, in violation of CBS's policy forbidding marriage between colleagues. With layoffs coming, he asks that one of them choose to be laid off to save face. Wershba volunteers to be let go. Murrow finishes his speech from the opening scene, extolling the importance of ideas and information, and that television's potential of informing and enlightening its audience shouldn't be discounted, else it will become \"merely wires and lights in a box.\" Murrow concludes his speech with his catchphrase, \"Good night, and good luck.\"",

    "plot": "Michael Dorsey is a respected actor, but nobody in New York City wants to hire him because he is a perfectionist and difficult to work with. He makes ends meet by working as a server in a restaurant and teaching acting classes. After many months without an acting job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera Southwest General from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester, who unsuccessfully auditions for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly. In desperation, and following an argument with his agent, Michael disguises himself as a woman named \"Dorothy Michaels\" and auditions for Southwest General himself, and he is cast as Emily Kimberly. Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play by his roommate Jeff Slater, which will star himself and Sandy. As \"Dorothy\", Michael plays Emily Kimberly as a plausible feminist, which surprises the other actors and the crew, who expected \"Dorothy\" to give a mild-mannered performance, in contrast to the empowered \" Gloria Steinem type\" suggested in the script. His character quickly becomes a national sensation. When Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed because he wants to try on her clothes for ideas for Dorothy's wardrobe, he covers up by claiming he wants to have sex with her. Sandy is receptive and they sleep together. Exacerbating matters further, Michael is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols, a single mother with a daughter from a previous relationship and in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle. At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line to which she had previously told \"Dorothy\" she would be receptive, she throws a drink in his face. Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie (having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice) makes it known that she is not a lesbian. Meanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn and Julie's widowed father, Les. Les proposes marriage, insisting that Dorothy think about it before answering. When Michael returns home, he finds John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them. A few minutes later, Sandy arrives, asking why he has not answered her calls. Michael admits he is in love with another woman, and Sandy screams and breaks up with him. The tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year. Michael extricates himself when a technical problem forces the cast to perform live, by improvising a revelation about Emily: that she is actually Edward, Emily's twin brother who took her place to avenge her. This allows everybody a way out, but Julie is so outraged at Michael's deception that she punches him in the stomach once the cameras have stopped rolling and storms off. Some weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play. He returns Les's engagement ring, and Les says, \"The only reason you're still living is because I never kissed you.\" Despite his anger, Les admits that Michael was good company as Dorothy, and Michael buys him a beer. Michael later waits for Julie outside the studio. She is reluctant to talk to him, but he tells her that he and her father played pool and had a good time. She finally admits she misses Dorothy. Michael tells her Dorothy is within him and he misses her too. He remarks, \"I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man.\" Julie forgives him and they walk away together, engaged in conversation.",

Woody is picked up by his son, David, who learns that he was attempting to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska , to collect a one-million-dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. Despite his family's insistence that it is a mail scam, Woody insists on going to Lincoln so he can collect the money and buy a new truck and air compressor. David plans to drive him there just so he can spend some time with him, and give his mother, Kate, a break. Woody's other son, Ross, does not feel that David owes him anything, because as a parent, Woody was a neglectful alcoholic. David takes the week off work and starts driving to Nebraska with Woody. While in Rapid City, South Dakota , Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. This results in Woody having to be admitted to a hospital overnight. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne in Madison County, Nebraska , and he convinces Woody to stop and see his brother, Ray. At a bar, David meets Woody's former business partner, Ed Pegram, who stole Woody's air compressor decades prior. Woody foolishly mentions winning the money, and the next day, the news of Woody's \"win\" has spread through the town like wildfire. The next day, Kate arrives by bus in Hawthorne, and Ross arrives by car soon after. The Hawthorne newspaper does a story on Woody stopping through town and its owner, Peg Nagy, tells a shocked David that his guarded nature and alcoholism come from being shot down over Korea . That night, Ed corners David in the men's room about some money he supposedly loaned Woody years ago, threatening legal action if he is not paid. The rest of Woody's family come to visit him as well, and many of the family members demand money that they believe Woody owes them from David and Ross.

While looking for it, David and Woody discover Ed reading the letter aloud at the bar, which humiliates Woody. After Woody takes the letter back and goes outside, David punches Ed in the face. Woody, dizzy from his head injury, has to sit down, and David tells him they are not going to continue on to Lincoln. Woody tells David that he wants the money so badly because he wants to leave his sons something after he dies. David takes Woody to the hospital in nearby Norfolk . In the middle of the night, Woody abruptly leaves and starts walking, so David relents and drives Woody the rest of the way to Lincoln. In Lincoln, Woody is told that he did not win, and the two head back to Billings. However, David trades in his Subaru Outback for a truck, and also buys him a new air compressor. While driving back through Hawthorne, David hides below the dash and lets Woody take the wheel of his truck for all to see, including Ed, who has a bruised face. Woody waves goodbye to everyone and drives out of town, then stops in the middle of the road and switches seats with David, who takes them the rest of the way back home.",

One of his knights, the Saxon Wilfred of Ivanhoe, searches for him, finally finding him being held by Leopold of Austria for an enormous ransom. Richard's treacherous brother, Prince John , knows about it but does nothing, enjoying ruling in his absence . Back in England, Ivanhoe, pretending to be a minstrel, meets Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert and Sir Hugh de Bracy, two of Prince John's Norman supporters. When the Norman party seeks shelter for the night, Ivanhoe leads them to Rotherwood, the home of his father, Cedric the Saxon. Cedric welcomes the knights coldly while Ivanhoe sneaks into the chamber of the Lady Rowena, Cedric's ward, and they kiss. Later, in private, Ivanhoe pleads with Cedric to aid in raising the ransom of 150,000 marks of silver to free Richard, but Cedric wants no part of helping any Norman. When Ivanhoe leaves, Wamba, Cedric's jester , asks to go with him and is made his squire. Later, the two men rescue the Jew, Isaac of York, another guest of Cedric's, from two Norman soldiers. Shaken, Isaac decides to return home to Sheffield . Ivanhoe escorts him there. Isaac's daughter Rebecca gives Ivanhoe her jewels, inherited from her mother, without her father's knowledge to buy a horse and armour for an important jousting tournament at Ashby . Prince John's intention is to use the tournament to demonstrate to the Saxons the futility of resisting his Norman rule. Many nobles are at the tournament, including Prince John. The Norman knights Brian de Bois-Guilbert, Hugh de Bracy, Front de Boeuf, Philip de Malvoisin and Ralph de Vipont defeat all Saxon comers. Then a mysterious Saxon knight appears, arrayed all in black, his face hidden behind his helm . He declines to reveal his name, but challenges all five Normans. He easily defeats Malvoisin, Vipont and Front de Boeuf, one after the other. When Ivanhoe salutes Rebecca, Bois-Guilbert is immediately smitten by her beauty. While Ivanhoe bests Bracy, he is seriously wounded in the shoulder. By this point, his identity has been guessed by his father and Robin Hood . In the last bout against Bois-Guilbert, Ivanhoe falls from his horse. He is carried off, to be tended to by Rebecca. Ivanhoe is taken to the woods under the protection of Robin Hood. The other Saxons led by Cedric make for the city of York , but are captured and taken to the castle of Front de Boeuf. When Ivanhoe hears the news, he gives himself up in exchange for his father's freedom. While reconciling with his father, Ivanhoe advises him in confidence that Robin Hood and his men have the castle surrounded. However, Bois-Guilbert treacherously keeps them both in order to find out the whereabouts of the ransom. Robin Hood's men storm the castle. In the fighting, Front de Boeuf drives Wamba to his death in a burning part of the castle and is slain in turn by Ivanhoe. The defense crumbles. Bois-Guilbert alone escapes, using Rebecca as a human shield; de Bracy is captured when he attempts to do the same with Rowena. The huge ransom is finally amassed, but the Jews face a cruel choice: free either Richard or Rebecca, for Prince John has set the price of her life at 100,000 marks, the Jews' contribution. Isaac chooses Richard. Cedric takes the ransom to Leopold of Austria, while Ivanhoe promises Isaac that he will rescue Rebecca. At Rebecca's trial, she is condemned to be burned at the stake as a witch , but Ivanhoe appears and challenges the verdict, invoking the right to \" wager of battle \". Prince John chooses Bois-Guilbert as the court's champion. Bois-Guilbert makes a last, desperate plea to Rebecca, offering to forfeit the duel in return for her love, though he would be forever disgraced. She refuses, saying, \"We are all in God's hands, sir knight.\" In the duel, Ivanhoe is unhorsed, but manages to pull Bois-Guilbert from his horse and mortally wound him with a battle axe . As he lies dying, Bois-Guilbert tells Rebecca that it is he who loves her, not Ivanhoe. Rebecca acknowledges this to Rowena. King Richard and his knights arrive to reclaim his throne.

    "name": "The Story of Louis Pasteur",
    "plot": "In 1860 Paris, a distraught man murders his wife's doctor. Chemist Louis Pasteur ( Paul Muni ) has publicized the theory that microbes cause diseases. Therefore, doctors should avoid spreading by washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments in boiling water. The doctor did not do this, and the wife died of puerperal fever after giving birth. France's medical academy dismisses Pasteur—notably his most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet ( Fritz Leiber Sr. )—as a crank whose recommendations are tantamount to witchcraft. Pasteur frankly calls attention to the risks of Charbonnet's non-sterile methods and correctly predicts that a member of Napoleon III 's royal family who Charbonnet is attending will die of puerperal fever. Pasteur is considered dangerous because his ideas have led to murder. When the Emperor comes down against him, Pasteur leaves Paris and moves to Arbois . In the 1870s, when the new French government tries to restore the economy after the Franco-Prussian War , they learn that many sheep are dying of anthrax , except around Arbois. They send representatives who realize that, after working with a small group of loyal researchers, Pasteur developed an anthrax vaccine. The medical academy still opposes him and says Arbois must be free of anthrax, so the government buys land there and invites sheep farmers to use it. Pasteur objects strongly, saying the soil is full of anthrax spores , and eventually proposes an experiment. He will vaccinate 25 of the newly arrived sheep; then they and a control group of 25 others will be injected with blood from a sheep with anthrax. Joseph Lister ( Halliwell Hobbes ), the pioneer of antiseptic surgery in England, is interested enough to attend. He witnesses Pasteur's success as all the vaccinated sheep remain healthy after the other 25 die. At this point, Jean Martel ( Donald Woods ), a young doctor who was formerly Charbonnet's assistant but now follows Pasteur, becomes engaged to Pasteur's daughter Annette ( Anita Louise ). The celebrations are short-lived, as a rabid dog runs through the town and bites a man. As a woman attempts to cure him by witchcraft, Pasteur laments that doctors would have no more chance of success. Moving back to Paris, he makes rabies his next project. He spreads the disease from one animal to another by injection but cannot detect any microbe being transferred ( viruses had not been discovered), and the method he used to create the anthrax vaccine fails. Charbonnet visits the lab to gloat over Pasteur's failure. He is so confident Pasteur is a quack that he injects himself with rabies—and is triumphant, as he does not get the disease. Pasteur is puzzled until his wife Marie ( Josephine Hutchinson ) suggests the sample may have weakened with age. This sets him on the right path, giving dogs progressively stronger injections. But before his experiments conclude, a frantic mother begs him to try his untested treatment on her son ( Dickie Moore ), who a rabid dog has bitten. Despite fearing imprisonment or even execution for Practicing without a license to provide medical treatment, Pasteur decides he must try to save the child. During the attempt, Dr. Zaranoff ( Akim Tamiroff ) arrives from Russia with a group of peasants exposed to rabies. They have volunteered to receive Pasteur's treatment. Annette goes into labor with Martel's child. The doctor to attend to her is unavailable, and the boy urgently needs Martel. Pasteur searches for another doctor, but he can only find Charbonnet. He begs Charbonnet to wash his hands and sterilize his instruments; Charbonnet finally agrees that if Charbonnet lives another month, Pasteur will retract and denounce all his work on rabies. Both men are honorable enough to respect the agreement. The birth goes well, but Pasteur suffers a mild stroke. Days later, word comes that Pasteur has permission to treat the still-alive Russians. He attends them in hospital for the first injections using a wheelchair and later a cane. The experiment is a success, and now even Charbonnet concedes he was wrong, tearing up Pasteur's retraction and asking for the shots himself. Afterwards, Pasteur hears that Lister will denounce him at the medical academy. He angrily attends, but it is actually a surprise. Lister praises him, Zaranoff presents him with a Russian medal, and the once-skeptical doctors honor him.",

Jess's daughter Mattie wants to remain a Quaker but has fallen in love with cavalry officer Gard Jordan, a love that is against her mother's wishes.

Eliza tells him that by turning his back on their religion he is turning his back on her, but Jess sees things a different way. Josh finds himself on the front line of the battle to stop the advance of the raiders, and only fires his gun when the man next to him is wounded.

While at the 30th Street Station waiting for a connecting train, Samuel goes into the men's room and witnesses the murder of undercover police officer Detective Ian Zenovich. Detective Captain John Book and his partner, Sergeant Elton Carter, are assigned to the case. They question Samuel, who is unable to identify the perpetrator from mugshots or a lineup. Samuel then sees a newspaper clipping in a trophy case of narcotics officer Lieutenant James McFee and points him out to Book as the murderer. Book investigates McFee and discovers that he was previously responsible for a seizure of expensive chemicals used to make black-market amphetamine , after which the chemicals disappeared. Book surmises that McFee sold the chemicals back to drug dealers, and Zenovich was investigating. Book expresses his suspicions to Chief of Police Paul Schaeffer, who advises Book to keep the case secret so that they can determine how to proceed. Book is later ambushed in his apartment parking garage by McFee, who shoots and wounds him before fleeing. Since only Schaeffer knew of Book's suspicions, Book realizes that Schaeffer is corrupt and tipped off McFee.

He is invited to participate in a barn raising for a newly-married couple, gaining Hochleitner's respect. However, the attraction between Book and Rachel is evident and causes gossip in the tight-knit community. Meanwhile, Schaeffer searches for Book by contacting authorities in the Amish area. However, since Amish communities have no modern means of communication and little contact with the outside world, he hits repeated dead ends. When Book goes into town with Eli to use a payphone to call his precinct, he learns that Carter was killed in the line of duty. Realizing that Schaeffer was behind it, Book calls him at his home (where the call cannot be traced), chastises him for being corrupt and threatens to kill him. As they leave town, a group of locals harass the Amish. Book retaliates, breaking with the Amish tradition of non-violence . The assault is reported to the local police, and word eventually gets back to Schaeffer. Upset with Book over the assault, Eli orders him to leave. Rachel approaches Book in a field, where they passionately embrace, finally acting on their feelings. Soon after, Schaeffer, McFee and another corrupt cop, Sergeant Leon \"Fergie\" Ferguson, arrive at the Lapp farm and take Rachel and Eli hostage. Eli manages to alert Book, and Book tells Samuel to hide at Hochleitner's farm. Book tricks Fergie into the corn silo and suffocates him under tons of corn , then uses Fergie's shotgun to kill McFee. Schaeffer holds Rachel and Eli at gunpoint, but Samuel secretly comes back to ring the Lapp farm's bell. Book confronts Schaeffer, who threatens to kill Rachel, but the bell has alerted and summoned all of the neighbors. With so many witnesses present, Schaeffer surrenders and is later arrested. With Rachel and Samuel no longer in danger, Book departs for Philadelphia, bidding farewell. Before he drives off, Eli wishes Book well by saying, \"You be careful out there among them English.”",

    "plot": "In August 2005, Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. She tells her daughter Caroline about blind clockmaker Mr. Gateau, hired to make a clock for a train station in 1918. It ran backwards and was made as a memorial for those who lost their sons in World War I , like Gateau himself. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from Benjamin Button's diary. On the evening of November 11, 1918 , a boy is born with the proportions of an infant but the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. His mother, Caroline, dies soon after childbirth and his father, wealthy manufacturer Thomas Button, abandons him on the porch of a nursing home . Caretaker Queenie and cook Mr. Weathers find the baby, and Queenie raises him as her own, naming him Benjamin. As the years pass, Benjamin physically blends in with the elderly residents but has the mind of a child. Physically aging in reverse, he transitions from a wheelchair to crutches and learns to walk. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home, and they connect instantly. Later, he accepts work on the tugboat Chelsea captained by Mike Clark. Thomas introduces himself to Benjamin, but does not reveal his true identity. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves for a work engagement with the tugboat crew and travels around the world. He sends postcards to Daisy, who is accepted into a ballet company in New York City . In Murmansk in 1941, Benjamin becomes smitten with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the chief minister of the British trade mission in Murmansk. [ 5 ] Their affair eventually ends, leaving Benjamin heartbroken. That December, the United States enters World War II . Mike volunteers the Chelsea for U.S. Navy service, and they are assigned to salvage duties. They find a near sunken U.S. transport and thousands of dead American troops. The culprit, a German U-boat , surfaces and fires on the tugboat. Captain Mike rams the submarine and the resulting explosion sinks both. Most of the crew perishes except for Benjamin and Rick Brody, who are eventually rescued. In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, reuniting with Queenie and learns that Weathers died. He reconnects with Daisy, who attempts to seduce him. However, Benjamin refuses, and she departs. Benjamin visits terminally ill Thomas and learns the details of his birth and family. Thomas gives his button manufacturing company and estate to Benjamin before dying. In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing her romantically involved with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in Paris . When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love. Queenie dies, and Benjamin and Daisy move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, announces she is pregnant. Their daughter, Caroline, is born in the spring of 1968. Believing he cannot be a proper father due to his reverse aging, Benjamin sells his assets, leaves the money for Daisy and Caroline, and leaves to travel alone during the 1970s. Benjamin, physically a young man, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now remarried, Daisy introduces him as a family friend to her husband Robert and daughter Caroline. She later visits him at his hotel, where they have sex and part once more. In 1990, recently widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who found Benjamin, who is now physically a pre-teen . He was living in a condemned building, was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and his diary had her name in it. Benjamin displays early signs of dementia , so Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life as he regresses into infancy. In 2002, Gateau's clock is replaced with a properly working modern digital clock and in 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 85 years old.

She initially ignores severe headaches and brief episodes of dizziness and double vision, but when she uncharacteristically takes a spill while riding and then tumbles down a flight of stairs, her secretary and best friend Ann King insists she see the family doctor, who refers her to a specialist. Dr. Frederick Steele is closing his New York City office in preparation for a move to Brattleboro, Vermont , where he plans to devote his time to brain cell research and scientific study on their growth. He reluctantly agrees to see Judy, who acts coldly and is openly antagonistic towards him. She shows signs of short-term memory loss but dismisses her symptoms. Steele convinces her the ailments she is experiencing are severe and potentially life-threatening and puts his career plans on hold to tend to her. When diagnostic tests confirm his suspicions, Judy agrees to surgery to remove a malignant glioma brain tumor. Steele discovers the tumor cannot be removed entirely and realizes she has less than a year to live. The end will be painless but swift; shortly after experiencing total blindness, Judy will die. To allow her a few more months of happiness, Steele opts to lie to Judy and Ann and assures them the surgery was a success. As he is a poor liar, Ann is suspicious and confronts Steele, who admits the truth. Steele tells Ann \"she must never know\" she will die soon. She agrees to remain silent and continue the lie. Judy and Steele become involved romantically and eventually engaged. While helping his assistant pack the office before their departure for Vermont, Judy discovers her case history file containing letters from several doctors, all of them confirming Steele's prognosis. Assuming Steele was marrying her out of pity, Judy breaks off the engagement and reverts to her former lifestyle. One day, her stable master Michael O'Leary, who for years has loved her from afar, confronts her about her unruly behavior, and she confesses she is dying. Their conversation convinces her she should spend her final months happy, dignified, and with the man she loves. She apologizes to Steele, and they marry and move to Vermont. Three months later, Ann comes to visit. Judy and she are in the garden planting bulbs when Judy comments on how odd it is she still feels the sun's heat under the rapidly darkening skies. They both immediately realize she is losing her vision and approaching the end. Judy makes Ann stay mum, as Steele leaves that day to present his most recent medical findings—which hold out the long-term prospect of a cure for her type of cancer—in New York. Judy makes an excuse to remain home, helps him pack, and sends him off, telling him, \"What we have now can't be destroyed. That's our victory, our victory over the dark. It's a victory because we're not afraid.\" Then, after bidding Ann, her housekeeper Martha (who has silently deduced the situation), and her dogs farewell, she goes to her bedroom. Martha follows Judy and, upon entering the room, pauses as she sees Judy kneeling briefly, apparently praying. Judy then lies down on the bed; Martha drapes a blanket over her, withdrawing quietly when Judy asks to be left alone.",

    "name": "The Towering Inferno",
    "plot": "Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of The Glass Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper that he designed for developer James Duncan. The tower, 1,688 feet (515 m) tall and 138 stories, is the world's tallest building. During testing, an electrical short-circuit starts a fire in a storage room on the 81st floor after another short occurs in the main utility room. While examining the latter short, Roberts sees the wiring is inadequate and suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and Duncan's son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who feigns innocence. During the dedication ceremony, chief of public relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower's lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to that floor, where Giddings is fatally burned pushing a guard away from the fire. With the dedication party now in full swing in the tower's Promenade Room on the 135th floor, Roberts reports the fire to Duncan, who is courting Senator Gary Parker for an urban renewal contract and refuses to order an evacuation. SFFD Chief Michael O'Hallorhan forces Duncan to evacuate the guests from the Promenade Room. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to bring the project back under budget, and suggests other subcontractors did likewise. Fire overtakes the express elevators, killing a group whose elevator stops on the engulfed 81st floor. Bigelow and his girlfriend Lorrie are killed when another fire traps them in the Duncan Enterprises offices on the 65th floor. Lisolette Mueller, a guest and resident of the tower being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a deaf mother and her two children. Security chief Jernigan rescues the mother, but a ruptured gas line explodes, destroying the stairwell and preventing Roberts and the rest from following. They traverse the wreckage of the stairwell to reach a service elevator that takes them to the 134th floor, but the door to the Promenade Room is blocked with hardened cement. Roberts uses a ventilation shaft to reach the room, while Lisolette and the children stay behind. As firefighters begin to bring the fire under control on floor 65, the electrical system fails, deactivating the passenger elevators; O'Hallorhan abseils down the elevator shaft to safety. As firemen ascend to free the blocked door at the Promenade Room, another explosion destroys part of the remaining stairwell, blocking the last means of escape from the upper floors. After the stuck door is freed, reuniting Lisolette and the children with Roberts and the others, Simmons tries to escape down the stairwell, but is blocked by flames and retreats. Meanwhile, Claiborne reveals his true identity and intentions to Lisolette, who says she does not care and still wants to be with him. An attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when two women run up to the aircraft; the pilot tries to evade them and crashes, setting the roof ablaze. A Navy rescue team attaches a breeches buoy between the Promenade Room and the roof of the adjacent 102-story Peerless Building, and rescues guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a \"gravity brake\" ( fall arrest ) on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for 12 people, including Roberts' fiancée Susan Franklin, Lisolette, and the children. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator to her death, and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable. O'Hallorhan rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter. As fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy, which is destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Senator Parker and others. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Hallorhan and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with plastic explosives . Although several are killed, including Mayor Ramsay, most of the remaining partygoers survive as water rushes through the building, extinguishing the flames. Claiborne, in shock upon hearing of Lisolette's death, is given her cat by Jernigan. Duncan consoles his grieving daughter, and promises such a disaster will never happen again. Roberts accepts O'Hallorhan's offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper. O'Hallorhan drives away, exhausted.",

Humiliated, Fran later persuades Sam to bypass England and go directly to Paris. Once in France, Fran imagines herself a sophisticated world traveler with a high-class social life and pretends she is much younger than her years. Sam notes that those who would socialize with \"hicks\" like them were not really high-class.

In addition, divorce is against their religion. Kurt asks Fran to postpone their wedding until he can get his mother's approval, but Fran knows it is hopeless. On a call, Sam agrees to sail home with Fran on the SS Rex and leaves Edith and her cautions that Fran can't make him happy.

The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora , a lush habitable moon orbiting a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi , 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature . To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists control Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic former Marine Jake Sully is recruited by the RDA to replace his deceased identical twin , who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Jake inadequate, but accepts him as an operator. While escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by the Na'vi princess Neytiri . Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch , head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe, and they choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree would damage the biological neural network that encompasses all Pandoran life, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate. Jake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Grace is shot and fatally wounded. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of the Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. Supported by Neytiri and the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Before the battle, Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties. The Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, in an AMP suit , escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to kill Jake's avatar, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. In the aftermath of the war, the RDA are expelled from Pandora; only some humans are chosen to stay, including Max and Norm. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, Neytiri, and Mo'at.",

    "plot": "The film opens with the narration: \"This is the story of a ship\". In 1941 HMS Torrin engages German transports in a night-time action during the Battle of Crete , but at dawn, the destroyer comes under attack from German bombers. A critical hit forces the crew to abandon the ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers and ratings manage to find a life raft while being intermittently strafed by German planes. The story of the ship is told in flashbacks, using their memories. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross, who recalls the summer of 1939 when the Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty. The Torrin spends a quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War , but in 1940 it fights its first engagement during the Battle of Narvik . During that action, the ship is struck by a torpedo . The damaged Torrin is towed back to port, all the time being harried by dive bombers. Safely back in harbour, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship's company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect, but one man did not. However, he surprises everyone when he says that he let him off with caution as he feels that, as captain, he failed to make him understand his duty. Returning to the present, the float survivors watch the capsized Torrin take on water and slowly sink. The raft is again strafed by German planes and some men are killed or wounded. Shorty Blake recalls in flashback how he met his wife-to-be, Freda, on a train while on leave. She is related to the Torrin ' s affable Chief Petty Officer Hardy. When both men return to sea, Freda moves in with Hardy's wife and mother-in-law. The Torrin participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (portrayed in the film by the 5th Battalion of the Coldstream Guards ). Blake gets a letter to say that Freda has given birth to his son during the Plymouth Blitz , but that Hardy's wife and mother-in-law were killed. He has to tell Hardy, who is writing a letter home, the bitter news. The survivors on the life raft watch the Torrin finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final \"three cheers\" for the Torrin . A British destroyer soon begins rescuing the men. Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying. Telegrams are sent to the crew's loved ones. Kinross addresses the ship's survivors in a military depot in Alexandria in Egypt. He tells them that although they lost their ship and many friends, who now \"lie together in fifteen hundred fathoms\", he notes that these losses should inspire them to fight even harder in the battles to come. Captain Kinross then shakes hands with all the ratings as they leave the depot. When the last man goes, the emotionally tired captain silently acknowledges his surviving officers before walking away. An epilogue concludes: Bigger and stronger ships are being launched to avenge the Torrin ; Britain is an island nation with a proud, indefatigable people; Captain Kinross is now in command of a battleship . Its massive main guns fire at the enemy.",

    "plot": "Three returning World War II veterans meet on a flight to their midwestern hometown of Boone City: USAAF bombardier captain Fred Derry, U.S. Navy petty officer Homer Parrish, and U.S. Army sergeant Al Stephenson. Each had left a very different life behind: Fred Derry had been a drug store soda jerk who lived with his parents on the wrong side of the tracks. Before shipping out, Fred married a gold-digger named Marie after a whirlwind romance. Marie has since been working in a nightclub to fill her time (and her nightlife) in spite of Fred's generous combat pay as an Air Force officer. Al Stephenson was an executive at a bank and lived in a luxury apartment with his wife, Milly, and their teenage children, Peggy and Rob. Homer Parrish was a star high school athlete living with his middle-class parents and younger sister. Homer had also been dating his next-door neighbor Wilma, whom he intended to marry upon his return from the war. Each man faces challenges integrating back into civilian life. Homer lost both hands in the war and though he has become functional in the use of his mechanical hooks , he cannot believe that Wilma will still want to marry him. Al, tired and jaded from the war, returns to the bank and is given a promotion, but wrestles with alcohol. Though highly decorated, Fred suffers from PTSD flashbacks by night. Fred arrives home and cannot locate his party girl wife, who does not expect him. The Stephensons and their daughter Peggy invite Fred along with them for the evening, bar hopping in celebration of Al's return. An inebriated Fred keeps asking Peggy who she is, and she reminds him that she is \"Al's daughter.\" When Fred is unable to get into his apartment, the Stephensons offer him a bed for the night. Later, Peggy calms Fred during a nightmare, and the two gradually become attracted to each other. When Peggy and her boyfriend invite Fred and Marie out to dinner, Peggy realizes how shallow and materialistic Marie is and becomes determined to break up her and Fred's marriage. Although proficient in managing the challenges of his disability, Homer is frustrated by his loss of independence and adjusting to his relationship with Wilma. Concerned that Wilma does not fully understand the difficulties of being married to him with his disabilities, Homer demonstrates to her how she will need to assist him at bedtime when he removes his harness with his prosthetic hands, leaving him helpless. Wilma reaffirms her love for Homer and says she can commit herself to him for life. Al continues to struggle with re-entry into civilian life. Widely respected by the bank's senior management for his past business acumen, Al is criticized after approving an unsecured loan to a farmer and fellow veteran who wants to buy forty acres, but has no collateral. With inhibitions lowered by excessive drinking , Al gives a speech at a work banquet that satirizes requiring a veteran to provide collateral before risking his life to take a hill in battle. With little work experience and unable to find a better job than soda jerk, Fred returns to the same drugstore. Fred and Peggy's attraction grows stronger, which puts Fred at odds with her father Al. When Homer visits Fred at the drugstore, another customer criticizes US involvement in the war, telling Homer his injuries were unnecessary. Homer responds angrily, and Fred intervenes on his behalf, punching the customer and consequently being fired. Meanwhile, Marie, frustrated with Fred's lack of financial success and missing her past nightlife, decides to get a divorce. Bitter and seeing no future in Boone City, particularly with Al telling him to stay away from Peggy, Fred decides to catch the next plane out. While waiting at the airport, Fred walks into an aircraft boneyard , climbing into a decommissioned B-17 bomber. Sitting in the bombardier's seat, Fred has another flashback. He is roused out of his stressful memories by a work crew foreman, who tells him the planes are being demolished for use in the growing prefab housing industry. Fred asks if they need help in the budding business and is hired. Al, Milly, and Peggy attend Homer and Wilma's wedding, where Fred is best man.

    "plot": "In 1958, 15-year-old Michael Berg becomes sick on a tram ride in an unnamed provincial city. He is helped by 36-year-old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz. Weeks later, Michael has recovered from scarlet fever and at his mother's insistence, he visits Hanna with flowers to thank her for her help. They proceed to have a secret summer love affair, and Hanna often asks Michael to read to her. They have a brief cycling holiday in the country where Michael starts to notice some oddities in Hanna's behaviour. However, as their sexual relationship deepens it grows more tumultuous, when his attempts to form a deeper connection are rebuffed by her secretive nature. As a good reliable worker, Hanna is soon promoted, whereupon she abruptly quits without explanation. Michael visits Hanna to apologize following an argument, but is utterly befuddled and devastated to find her apartment vacant. In 1966, Michael is a student at Heidelberg University Law School and observes a war crime trial of several former female SS guards accused of letting 300 Jewish women and children perish in a burning church during a death march near Kraków in Poland . Michael is horrified to learn Hanna is one of the defendants. Survivor Ilana Mather provides testimony, including that Hanna forced some of the prisoners to read to her. Hanna admits that she and the co-defendants each chose ten women monthly for extermination at Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland. Ilana's mother Rose testifies that when the church caught fire during a bombing, the guards refused to unlock the doors. The official SS report stated the guards did not know about the fire until the following day. Hanna reveals the guards in fact kept the doors locked so that the prisoners could not escape. Hanna's co-defendants all state she was in command and wrote the report. Hanna denies this, insisting they agreed on the contents of the report together. When the lead judge asks for a handwriting sample, Hanna quickly condemns herself by admitting she authored the report alone. Recalling their time together, Michael is initially confounded by her testimony, finally deducing that Hanna is deeply ashamed of being illiterate . Michael informs his law professor, who states that Michael should inform the court. Deeply conflicted, Michael attempts to visit Hanna in prison, but changes his mind. Hanna receives a sentence of life imprisonment , while her co-defendants are sentenced to just over four years each. Michael attempts to move on, though haunted by the memories of a relationship that he cannot put to rest. He marries and has a daughter, however, Michael cannot commit fully to the relationship and grows distant from his family, culminating in divorce and estrangement from his daughter, Julia. Throughout the 1980s, Michael records himself on tape reading various books and regularly mails them to Hanna. Borrowing the same books from the prison library, Hanna slowly teaches herself to read and write. She starts writing to Michael, but he never replies. In 1988, a prison official requests Michael's help with Hanna's parole as he has been the only person outside prison to have had contact with her. Michael finally visits Hanna, revealing in the stilted reunion that he has secured her a residence and a job. When Michael arrives for Hanna's release, he is told she hanged herself in her cell and left a crude will asking Michael to give her money to Ilana Mather. Michael finds Ilana in New York City , revealing his connection to Hanna and its long-lasting impact. He tells Ilana about Hanna's illiteracy, but she rebuffs this and refuses to forgive Hanna. Michael gives her Hanna's tea tin filled with cash, but Ilana refuses the money. He suggests it be donated to a Jewish literacy organization in Hanna's name and Ilana agrees. She keeps the tin, placing it next to a photograph of her deceased family. The film ends in 1995 with Michael driving Julia to Hanna's grave, telling her their story.",

The guests luxuriate on the yacht, oblivious to the crew working to meet their every need and whim.

    "plot": "In German-occupied Kraków during World War II , the Nazis force local Polish Jews into the overcrowded Kraków Ghetto . Oskar Schindler , a German Nazi Party member from Czechoslovakia , arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribes Wehrmacht (German armed forces) and SS officials, acquiring a factory to produce enamelware . Schindler hires Itzhak Stern , a Jewish official with contacts among black marketeers and the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS to concentration camps or killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist. SS- Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth arrives in Kraków to oversee construction of the Płaszów concentration camp . When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory. As the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów to Auschwitz concentration camp . Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to a munitions factory he plans to build in Brünnlitz near his hometown of Zwittau . Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names. As the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss , the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe the Sabbath . Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders. As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing Red Army to avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a Talmudic paraphrase: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car.

    "obfuscated_plot": "During a war in an occupied city, an oppressive regime forces local minority group members into a cramped urban ghetto. A businessman from a neighboring country arrives in the city, hoping to profit from the war. He bribes military officials and acquires a factory to produce industrial goods. He hires a local administrator who helps him navigate business connections and ensure that workers are deemed essential to prevent their deportation.\n\nThe businessman initially maintains friendly relations with the regime and enjoys his newfound wealth. A high-ranking military official arrives to oversee a nearby prison camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: many people are transported to the camp, while others are killed in the streets. The businessman witnesses the massacre and is deeply affected, particularly by a young girl in a distinctive coat.\n\nAs time passes, the businessman's focus shifts from making money to saving lives. He carefully maintains relationships with military officials through strategic bribes. When the regime begins losing the war, he negotiates to transfer his workers to a different factory in another town. He creates a list of 1,100 people to be saved, even bribing officials to redirect workers who are mistakenly sent to a death camp.\n\nAt the new factory, he protects his workers by restricting military access and allowing them to observe their religious practices. He spends his entire fortune bribing officials and deliberately produces unusable industrial materials. As the war ends, he must flee to avoid capture, but first ensures his workers will be safe.\n\nThe workers give him a meaningful gift and a document recognizing his life-saving actions. He leaves, emotionally overwhelmed by both his achievements and his belief that he could have done more. The workers are eventually liberated by approaching military forces.\n\nAn epilogue reveals that the oppressive official was executed for war crimes, while the businessman and his wife were later honored for their humanitarian efforts. Survivors and their descendants eventually visit his memorial site."

    "plot": "In January 1865, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln expects the American Civil War to end soon, with the defeat of the Confederate States . He is concerned that his 1863 Emancipation Proclamation may be discarded by the courts after the war and that the proposed Thirteenth Amendment will be defeated by the returning slave states . He feels it imperative to pass the amendment beforehand, to foreclose any possibility that freed slaves might be re-enslaved. The Radical Republicans fear the amendment will be defeated by some who wish to delay its passage; support from Republicans in the states is not yet assured. The amendment also requires the support of several Democratic congressmen to pass. With dozens of Democrats being lame ducks after losing their re-election campaigns in 1864 , some of Lincoln's advisors believe that he should wait for a new Republican-heavy Congress . Lincoln's hopes rely upon Francis Preston Blair , a founder of the Republican Party whose influence could win over members of the state conservative faction. With two sons serving in the Union army , Blair wants to end hostilities before the spring thaw arrives and the armies march again. In return for his support, Blair insists that Lincoln allow him to engage the Confederate government in peace negotiations. However, Lincoln knows that significant support for the amendment comes from Radical Republicans, for whom negotiated peace is unacceptable. Unable to proceed without Blair's support, Lincoln reluctantly authorizes his mission. In the meantime, Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward work to secure Democratic votes for the amendment. Lincoln suggests that they concentrate on the lame-duck Democrats, as they will feel freer to vote as they choose and soon need employment; Lincoln will have many federal jobs to fill as he begins his second term. Despite being unwilling to offer monetary bribes to the Democrats, Lincoln and Seward authorize agents to contact Democratic congressmen with offers of federal jobs in exchange for their support. Meanwhile, Lincoln's son, Robert , returns from Harvard Law School and announces his intention to discontinue his studies and enlist in the Union Army, hoping to earn a measure of honor and respect outside of his father's shadow. Lincoln reluctantly secures an officer's commission for Robert. Mary Todd Lincoln , the First Lady, fears that Robert will be killed and presses her husband to pass the amendment and end the war, promising woe upon him if he should fail. At a critical moment in the debate in the United States House of Representatives , racial-equality advocate Thaddeus Stevens agrees to moderate his position and argue that the amendment represents only legal equality, not a declaration of actual equality. Meanwhile, Confederate envoys are ready to meet with Lincoln to discuss terms for peace, but he instructs that they be kept out of Washington, D.C. as the amendment approaches a vote on the House floor. Rumor of their mission circulates, prompting both Democrats and conservative Republicans to advocate postponing the vote. In a carefully worded statement, Lincoln denies that there are envoys in Washington, and the vote proceeds, passing by a margin of two votes. Black visitors to the gallery celebrate, and Stevens returns home to his \"housekeeper\" and lover, a biracial woman named Lydia Hamilton Smith . When Lincoln meets with the Confederates , he tells them that slavery cannot be restored, as the North is united for ratification of the amendment, and several of the southern states' reconstructed legislatures would also vote to ratify. As a result, the peace negotiations fail, and the war continues. On April 3, Lincoln visits the battlefield at Petersburg, Virginia and speaks with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant . On April 9, Grant receives General Robert E. Lee 's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse . On April 14, Lincoln meets members of his cabinet to discuss future measures to enfranchise blacks, before leaving for Ford's Theatre . That night, while Lincoln's son Tad is watching a play at Grover's Theatre , the manager stops the play to announce that the President has been shot . The next morning, at the Petersen House , Lincoln dies with a peaceful expression across his face. In a flashback, Lincoln finishes intoning his second inaugural address on March 4 with the words, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all\".",

Four black girls walking down stairs in the Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church are killed by a bomb set by the Ku Klux Klan . Annie Lee Cooper attempts to register to vote in Selma, Alabama , but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. King travels to Selma with Ralph Abernathy , Andrew Young , James Orange , and Diane Nash . James Bevel greets them, and other SCLC activists appear. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests they disrupt his marriage. Coretta Scott King has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer Mahalia Jackson to inspire him with a song. King, other SCLC leaders, and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff Jim Clark to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others. Alabama Governor George Wallace speaks out against the movement. Coretta meets with Malcolm X , who says he will drive whites to ally with King by advocating a more extreme position. Wallace and Al Lingo decide to use force at an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama , using state troopers to assault the marchers. A group of protesters runs into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in and beat and shoot Jimmie Lee Jackson . King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to ask people to continue to fight for their rights. Harassing phone calls with a recording of sexual activity implied to be King and another woman lead to an argument with Coretta; she knows it is a fabrication, but the strain of constant death threats has taken its toll on her. King is criticized by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). As the Selma-to-Montgomery march is about to begin, King talks to Young about delaying it for a day so he can spend some time with his family, but Young convinces King to let the march begin as scheduled without him, saying he can join later. The marchers, including John Lewis of SNCC, Hosea Williams of SCLC, and Selma activist Amelia Boynton , cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back and, when the marchers hold their ground, the troopers attack with clubs, horses, tear gas , and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television and the wounded are treated at Brown Chapel , the movement's headquarter church. Movement attorney Fred Gray asks federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson to let another attempt at the march go forward. President Johnson demands that King and Wallace cease their activities and sends Assistant Attorney General John Doar to convince King to postpone the next march. Numerous white Americans, including Viola Liuzzo , Archbishop Iakovos , and James Reeb , arrive to join the second march. Marchers cross the bridge again and see the state troopers lined up, but the troopers turn aside to let them pass. King, after praying, turns around and leads the group away, which again draws sharp criticism from SNCC activists. That evening, Reeb is beaten to death by an angry white mob on a street in Selma. After a hearing, Judge Johnson approves the march. President Johnson speaks before a Joint Session of Congress to ask for quick passage of a bill to eliminate restrictions on voting , praising the courage of the activists. The march on the highway to Montgomery takes place, and, when the marchers reach Montgomery, King delivers a speech on the steps of the State Capitol .",

A customer offers $1 to anyone who can address his worries, and Guthrie succeeds by providing a satisfactory answer. Subsequently, Guthrie begins painting a sign but frustrates his wife, Mary, by abandoning the task—their only reliable source of income—to engage in music instead. At a local bar, Guthrie performs for a woman named Sue Ann and spends the night with her. On his porch, he encounters Heavy Chandler, a recently released mental patient, and encourages him to express his thoughts through painting. After performing at a square dance, a dust storm compels everyone indoors. Guthrie suggests to Mary that he should leave to seek work, and eventually, he departs, leaving her a note. During his travels, Guthrie rides a train with Slim Snedeger and other hobos. When a fight breaks out, Guthrie and Slim jump to another train; however, railroad enforcers compel those without money to disembark. Slim is able to afford the fare, but Guthrie, being broke, continues on foot, and they part ways. Guthrie later offends a middle-class couple who provide him a ride, leading them to drop him off. In a bar, he earns a meal by playing the piano and spends the night with a waitress. He subsequently rides with a family bound for California, but at the state border, police demand $50 for entry. Guthrie leaves the family and joins a nearby hobo camp. In Los Angeles , he meets Luther and Liz Johnson, a migrant couple struggling to find employment. Upon discovering that jobs are both scarce and poorly compensated, Guthrie offers to paint a sign at a soup kitchen, but his only recompense is a serving of soup. Later, union organizer Ozark Bule arrives at the camp, performing union songs. When company thugs disrupt the gathering, Guthrie escapes with Ozark, who assists him in obtaining a radio job where Guthrie's songs about the working class achieve popularity. However, station owner Mr. Locke insists that Guthrie refrain from singing about unions and instead focus on entertainment. Although Guthrie initially acquiesces, he eventually resumes performing protest songs, resulting in conflict with Locke. Ultimately refusing to compromise, Guthrie is dismissed from his position. He brings Mary and their children to Los Angeles, but he feels out of place amid the wealth surrounding him. Luther, bruised from a beating, informs Guthrie that his songs provide inspiration to the laborers. Frustrated, Guthrie tears up a list of \"safe\" songs, leaves the studio, and resumes traveling, performing protest songs at migrant camps and factories. While performing at a fruit-packing plant, Guthrie is assaulted by company enforcers, who destroy his guitar. Undeterred, he continues to travel by train and perform his songs.

As Guthrie departs, Ozark informs him that an agent has arranged a coast-to-coast radio show for him and secured an audition at the prestigious Ambassador Hotel . Guthrie purchases toys for his children, only to discover that Mary and the girls have already left.

New York City Police Department Sergeant Krupke and Lieutenant Schrank disband their latest scuffle, with Schrank deriding their conflict as pointless since the neighborhood will soon be demolished to make way for Lincoln Center . The gangs are too proud to care, and Jet leader Riff proposes a rumble between the two gangs. He approaches his friend Tony, who is on parole, for help. Tony declines, wishing to reform himself with the help of Valentina, the Puerto Rican owner of Doc's general store. Meanwhile, María, Shark leader Bernardo's sister, is betrothed to his friend Chino, but yearns for an independent future. At a neighborhood dance in the community center that night, Tony and María meet and fall in love, infuriating Bernardo; however, Bernardo accepts Riff's terms to participate in the proposed rumble, provided that Tony attends as well. Tony later confesses his love to María on her fire escape , and they vow to reconvene the next day. Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita argue about life in New York compared to Puerto Rico, with Anita's belief in the American Dream contrasting with Bernardo's rude pessimism. Police interrogate the Jets, who deny any knowledge about the rumble. During their date at the Cloisters, Tony reveals to María that his year-long imprisonment for nearly beating a rival gang member to death had scared him into reforming. María makes Tony promise to stop the rumble, and they make promises to one another as if marrying before God. Later, Tony tries to convince Riff to call off the rumble by stealing his newly bought gun, but the Jets steal it back, with Riff reasserting that the rumble will happen as scheduled. Schrank orders Krupke and other police officers to stop the rumble from occurring, but they are unsuccessful. Arriving at the rumble, Tony speaks to Riff, who is so confident Tony has joined them, he relinquishes the gun. Tony then explains his feelings for Maria to Bernardo.

Schrank interrogates María at her apartment about Tony's whereabouts. María sends Anita to ask Valentina about the safety of \"a cousin\" as a way of passing on a warning for Tony in front of Schrank.

Late one night, police officer Sam Wood discovers Colbert's murdered body in the street. Wood finds Virgil Tibbs , a black man with a fat wallet, at the train station and arrests him. Police chief Bill Gillespie accuses him of murder and robbery but learns Tibbs is a homicide detective from Philadelphia , who was passing through town after visiting his mother. Tibbs wants to leave town on the next train, but his Chief in Philadelphia suggests he stay in Sparta to help Gillespie with the murder investigation. Though Gillespie, like many of Sparta's white residents, is racist, he and Tibbs reluctantly agree to work together. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for less than an hour when his body was found. Tibbs examines the body and concludes that the murder happened much earlier, the killer was right-handed, and the victim had been killed elsewhere and moved to where Wood found his body. Gillespie arrests another suspect, Harvey Oberst, who protests his innocence. Tibbs, after being jailed for withholding his findings subsequent to examining the body, reveals that Oberst is left-handed and has witnesses to confirm his alibi . Frustrated by the ineptitude of the police but impressed by Tibbs, Colbert's widow threatens to halt construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation. Tibbs initially suspects the murderer is wealthy plantation owner Eric Endicott, a genteel racist and Sparta's most powerful citizen, who opposed Colbert's new factory. When Tibbs begins interrogating him, Endicott slaps him, and Tibbs slaps him back. Afterwards, Endicott sends a gang of thugs after him. Gillespie rescues Tibbs and tells him to leave town to save himself, but Tibbs is determined to stay and solve the case. Tibbs asks Officer Wood to re-trace his patrol car route during the night of the murder; Gillespie joins them. After questioning why Wood detours from his patrol route, Tibbs discovers that Wood enjoys passing the house of 16-year-old Delores Purdy, who walks around nude with the lights on in an attempt to entice men, and that Wood changed his route to prevent Tibbs from seeing her. Gillespie learns that Wood made a $632 deposit to his bank account the day after the murder. He arrests Wood, despite Tibbs's protests that he is not the murderer. Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood because he could not have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town. Delores' older brother Lloyd, a hostile racist, brings her to the police station to file statutory rape charges against Wood for getting her pregnant. When Tibbs insists on being present during Delores' questioning, Lloyd is offended and gathers a lynch mob to attack Tibbs. Tibbs pressures illegal abortionist Mama Caleba to reveal that she is about to provide an abortion for Delores. When Delores arrives and sees Tibbs, she runs away. Tibbs follows Delores and confronts her armed boyfriend, Ralph Henshaw, a cook at a roadside diner. Lloyd's mob arrives and holds Tibbs at gunpoint. Tibbs tells Lloyd to check Delores' purse for the $100 Ralph gave her for an abortion , which he got from killing and robbing Colbert. Lloyd realizes that Tibbs is right when he opens the purse and finds the money. After Lloyd confronts Ralph for getting his sister pregnant, Ralph shoots Lloyd dead. Tibbs grabs Ralph's gun. Ralph is arrested and confesses to killing Colbert. He explains that after hitchhiking a ride with Colbert and asking him for a job, Ralph attacked him at the construction site of the new factory, intending only to knock him unconscious and rob him but accidentally killing him instead. Tibbs arrives at the station to meet his train to return to Philadelphia, as Gillespie, having carried his suitcase, shakes Tibbs' hand and bids him farewell. In their final interaction, as Tibbs ascends the stairs onto the train, Gillespie sincerely tells him: \"You take care, you hear?\" After a hesitation, Tibbs gives a warm smile and says, \"Yeah.” Gillespie smiles back at Tibbs as he boards the train.",

    "plot": "In 2035, the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. A severe dust storm threatens their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) and in the ensuing evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by flying debris and presumed dead. Facing imminent peril, the remaining crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the Hermes , which will then return them to Earth. Watney awakens after the storm, narrowly surviving from his injuries. As he recovers within the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\"), he begins a video diary to document his thoughts on survival. Unable to communicate with Earth, his only chance of rescue is the next Mars mission in four years, where Ares IV will land at the Schiaparelli crater . The Ares IV MAV has already arrived on the site in preparation for the mission. With this timeframe in mind, Watney's main survival concerns are food and travel. Being a botanist , he cultivates a potato garden inside the Hab using the crew's bio-waste with Martian soil , and creates water from leftover rocket fuel. He also modifies a crewed rover for the journey to Schiaparelli. On Earth, NASA satellite planner Mindy Park notices Watney's activity from recorded satellite images, and suspects he must be alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders releases the news to the public but decides not to inform the Ares III crew en route to Earth, over flight director Mitch Henderson's strong objection. Watney explores the surrounding terrain and studies his maps, but he quickly journeys out to retrieve the Pathfinder probe, hoping to restore its communications. Mars missions director Vincent Kapoor realizes this strategy, and quickly visits Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng to use their replica of the probe. The agency makes contact with Watney and instructs him to link Pathfinder to the rover, where he can now communicate by text. With this breakthrough, Henderson is finally allowed to inform Watney's crewmates. As Watney enters the Hab on one evening, a leak in the airlock causes an explosion that injures him and destroys the potato garden. Although he repairs the airlock, he is again threatened by starvation. NASA scrambles to procure a resupply ship for Watney, with Sanders ordering routine safety inspections bypassed to expedite the mission. This oversight results in catastrophe as the ship disintegrates shortly after launch. The China National Space Administration decides to offer a launch vehicle — originally intended for the Taiyang Shen space probe — to resupply Watney. Astrophysicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: send the Taiyang Shen launcher to resupply the Hermes , which will then use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\" back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders flatly rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the Ares III crew. Henderson surreptitiously sends the proposal to the crew, and they unanimously vote in favor and divert the Hermes . Sanders is forced to support them publicly, but demands Henderson's resignation after the mission. After waiting several months, Watney embarks on the long journey to the Ares IV MAV. He plans to use it to rendezvous with the Hermes , but needs to lighten the load considerably by partially dismantling the cockpit. He takes off to orbit, but the Hermes crew find that they remain too far and too fast to retrieve him. Commander Lewis quickly improvises to explode the airlock in part of the ship, resulting in air violently escaping and slowing them down. Lewis also pilots a tethered Manned Maneuvering Unit to personally reach Watney, but they are still too far apart. Watney quickly improvises by piercing his pressure suit, and propels himself with the escaping air only to narrowly catch onto Lewis. NASA and spectators across the world all celebrate the successful rescue. After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives watching the launch footage.",

Aron expresses half-hearted interest and says goodbye to the girls, who head home. He continues through a slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon .

At one point, the knife falls off his hand, and he is forced to use his bare feet and a little branch to recover it. Over the next five days, Aron rations his food and remaining 300ml of water, struggles to keep warm at night, and is forced to drink his urine when his water runs out. He also sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder. Throughout the days, Aron becomes desperate and depressed and begins hallucinating about escape, relationships, and past experiences, including his family and his former girlfriend, Rana. He also imagines going to the party he was invited to and having fun. During one hallucination, Aron realizes his mistake was that he did not tell anyone where he was going or for how long.

The guards supervise three prisoners: Eduard Delacroix, who is frequently tormented by Percy; the violent and erratic William Wharton; and John Coffey, a hulking yet gentle and simple-minded African-American man convicted of raping and murdering two white girls after being found distraught while cradling their bodies. John asserts that he tried to \"take it back\", but could not. Paul grows doubtful that John committed the crimes and soon discovers he possesses miraculous healing abilities. John cures Paul's crippling bladder infection by absorbing it into himself before expelling it as flies, explaining that he \"took it back\". After Percy crushes Eduard's pet mouse, Mr. Jingles, John urgently requests the body and resurrects it, further convincing the guards of his powers. Fed up with Percy's behavior, the officers let him officiate an execution on the condition that he take a job at Briar Ridge insane asylum afterward. At Eduard's execution, Percy deliberately neglects to wet the sponge meant to conduct electricity, causing Eduard an agonizing death. John senses and is overwhelmed by Eduard's pain, causing him to inadvertently transfer some of his power into Mr. Jingles, who scurries away. Paul convinces the guards (excluding Percy) to take John to heal warden Hal's terminally ill wife, Melinda. They straitjacket Percy and confine him to a padded cell as punishment for torturing Eduard before sneaking John out of the prison to the warden's home. John absorbs Melinda's illness, restoring her health, but is left in severe pain from containing it within him. The guards return John to his cell, and release Percy, but John grabs hold of and transfers the illness into Percy, who, in a possessed state, shoots Wharton dead. Paul demands answers, leading John to transfer into him Wharton's memories, revealing him to be responsible for the crimes of which John was convicted. Percy is left catatonic and later committed to Briar Ridge. Though convinced of John's innocence, Paul cannot prove it or stop the execution. He offers John a chance to escape, believing it unacceptable to destroy what he considers to be a true miracle. John, however, exhausted by the pain he endures from constantly sensing the suffering and ugliness that people inflict on each other, chooses to die. His last request is to watch a movie, never having seen one before, so he, Paul, and the other officers watch Top Hat (1935). When John is taken to be executed, he tells the guards of his last dream, in which he and the two girls are safe and happy. John is saddened by the hatred he feels from those in attendance, who still believe him to be guilty, but Brutus encourages him to focus on the guards, who do not hate him. John requests not to wear a hood, because he is afraid of the dark. Paul briefly takes John's hand before the tearful officers reluctantly carry out the execution. In 1999, Paul, now 108 years old, watches Top Hat and, reminded of the events, recounts John's story to his friend Elaine, revealing it was the last execution he and Brutus performed before transferring to juvenile corrections.

While she calls Paul's longevity a miracle, he sees having outlived all his loved ones as a divine punishment for allowing John to die.

A few days into the voyage, Harvey falls overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland . He is rescued by a fisherman, Manuel Fidello, and taken aboard the fishing schooner We're Here , from Gloucester, Massachusetts . The schooner's captain, Disko Troop, doesn't believe Harvey's claims about his father's wealth, and refuses to take Harvey back to New York . To Harvey's shock, he intends fishing on the Grand Banks for three more months. Captain Troop offers Harvey temporary crew membership until they return to port. Harvey is reluctant to do real work but prodded by Manuel, a proud but simple Portuguese immigrant, eventually accepts. Befriended also by Captain Troop's son, Dan, he becomes acclimated to the demanding fishing lifestyle. Harvey begins to partner with Manuel in his dory. When a prank of Harvey's causes a fish hook to lodge in a crewman's arm, Manuel defends the boy. The We're Here fills with fish and turns for home. During the climactic race back to Gloucester against a rival schooner, the Jennie Cushman , Manuel climbs to the top of the mast to furl the sail. The mast cracks and he is plunged into the icy sea, tangled in the rigging. The weight of the broken mast and rigging threaten to capsize the ship. Manuel speaks to the cook in Portuguese, and the cook tells Captain Troop that all the bottom half of Manuel is gone, and Manuel doesn't want the boy to see. Manuel tells Captain Troop to cut the rigging free, knowing he will drown with it. Harvey crawls out on the wreckage, crying and distraught, while Captain Troop wields an axe. Finally Manuel kisses the cross around his neck and sinks below the water. We're Here returns to port and Harvey is reunited with his father Frank, who is impressed by his son's maturity. Harvey grieves for Manuel, pushing Frank away and wanting to stay on the We're Here , but Troop reassures Frank, telling him that there is room in Harvey's heart for both men and that once there Frank \"will find Manuel mighty satisfactory company.\" At the church, Harvey lights two candles, one from Manuel to Manuel's father and one from him to Manuel. Frank overhears Harvey praying that someday he will be with Manuel again and follows the boy to Manuel's dory, floating near the ship. Harvey is inconsolable and begs Frank to leave him alone. The next day, in front of the Fisherman's Memorial , Harvey and Frank join the community in casting bouquets and wreaths on the outgoing tide in tribute to the souls lost during this fishing season. The last shot shows the Cheynes' car speeding down the road with Manuel's dory on a trailer behind. Through the side window we see Harvey gesturing animatedly and his father laughing, regaled with stories of Harvey's adventures.",

    "plot": "Marmaduke Ruggles is valet to the Earl of Burnstead in 1908. Earl tells Ruggles that he has gambled him away in a drunken game of poker, and he is to report to his new masters – nouveau riche American millionaires Egbert and Effie Floud – immediately. Ruggles bemoans the idea of being relegated to \"the land of slavery,\" but he takes his new occupation in stride. Egbert slips away from Effie and takes Ruggles to a Parisian café. He explains to the valet that, in America, everyone is equal, and Ruggles should behave like a friend rather than a deferential servant. Ruggles is dismissive, but after a night of drinking with Egbert and his wild friend Jeff Tuttle, his \"stiff upper lip\" falls away as he follows the examples of Egbert and Tuttle. The three embark on an alcohol-fueled trip across Paris which ends with them returning to the Floud's hotel room. The next day Ruggles is embarrassed, and he apologizes to Effie for his behavior. The Flouds return to the town of Red Gap in America. Ruggles meets the extended family of the Flouds, including \"Ma\" Pettingill, Effie's mother, and Charles Belknap-Jackson, a snooty relative of Effie's who treats Ruggles with disdain. A party held to receive the Flouds inadvertently turns into a warm welcome for Ruggles after Ruggles is mistaken for a wealthy retired Englishman. Ruggles also meets Mrs. Judson, a widowed housewife and cook. When Belknap-Jackson chastises Ruggles for dancing at the party with Mrs. Judson, Ruggles kicks him in the behind. He is almost fired, but his job is saved as a newspaper article describing Ruggles as an \"honored houseguest\" of the Flouds makes him a local celebrity. Ruggles becomes a fixture in society, as Effie and Belknap-Jackson use his status to advance socially. He begins a relationship with Mrs. Judson and reads about the history of the United States. One day, after the rest of the family have left on a trip, Belknap-Jackson fires Ruggles. While waiting for the train, Ruggles wanders into the local saloon where he finds Mrs. Judson, Egbert, and Ma. Egbert laughs off Belknap-Jackson's actions, but Ruggles explains that he wants to live as a free and independent person and, because of that, he won't return to work for the Flouds. Egbert compares this to \"what Lincoln said at Gettysburg\", but neither he, nor any of the other people in the saloon can remember the words. As they each try to remind themselves of what it says, Ruggles stands up and recites the entire Gettysburg Address from memory. Ruggles decides to open a restaurant in Red Gap. As he is preparing the restaurant space with Mrs. Judson, Effie arrives with troubling news: the Earl of Burnstead is visiting Red Gap to buy Ruggles back from the Flouds. Ruggles reluctantly agrees to return to the Flouds, but Mrs. Judson is disgusted by his deference to his former employers. On the night of a party in the Earl's honor, Ruggles goes missing. Egbert convinces the Earl to slip out to another, more raucous party hosted by the beautiful young Nell Kenner, to whom the Earl instantly takes an interest. They eventually return to the Floud house, just as Ruggles returns and informs the Earl of his decision to \"be someone\" and live independently, on his own terms. The restaurant opening proves to be a great success. All the friends he has made on his journey from England to America attend its gala opening. Belknap-Jackson also attends and insults Ruggles and his cooking to his face, so Ruggles throws him out. Ruggles retreats to the kitchen, sure that he has ruined his social standing in Red Gap. Outside, the diners begin to sing \"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,\" but Ruggles doesn't realize they are singing for him. Egbert pulls him out of the kitchen, saying: \"Why, you old plate of soup, they're singing it for you!\" As the song crescendos, Egbert pushes Ruggles back into the kitchen so that he can celebrate privately with Mrs. Judson.

He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer constantly flirting and engaging in sexual encounters with a stream of women. Each morning, he begins his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine , Alka-Seltzer , and Dexedrine , always concluding by looking at himself in the mirror and saying, \"It's showtime, folks!\" Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique in a nightclub setting, discussing his life with her. As Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he vents his anger on the dancers and in his choreography. This leads to a highly sexualized number of topless women during a rehearsal, frustrating the show's penny-pinching backers. One of the few moments of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of The Stand-Up , moving him to tears. During a table-read of NY/LA , Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina . Joe brushes off his symptoms, attempting to leave for rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from exhaustion. NY/LA is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, smoking and drinking while hosting endless streams of women in his room. As he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie remaining by his side for support. A negative review for The Stand-Up , released during Joe's hospitalization, comes in despite the film's financial success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event. While Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery , the producers of NY/LA realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon's death: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, all berating him for his behavior.

As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (\"Bye Bye Life\", a whimsical parody of \" Bye Bye Love \"). In his dying dream, Joe can thank his family and acquaintances, as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation.

He has been reassigned from combat duties in Korea by General Webster, the father of his fiancée, Eileen. While Ace and Eileen have been together for years, their relationship has become strained. Airman Joe Kelly, Ace's enlisted crew chief, is about to wed a Japanese woman, Katsumi, in spite of the disapproval of the military establishment , which will not recognize the interracial marriage because it is generally illegal under American law . The Air Force, including Ace, is against the marriage. Ace and Joe have an argument during which Ace uses a racial slur to describe Katsumi. Ace eventually apologizes, then agrees to be Joe's best man at the wedding. Ace falls in love with a Japanese entertainer, Hana-ogi, who is the lead performer for the  all-female \"Matsubayashi\", a Takarazuka -like theater company, whom he meets through Katsumi. Eileen realizes that Ace's attentions are no longer focused on her and begins a friendship with a famous Kabuki performer, Nakamura. After overhearing that Joe's house has been under surveillance by the Army, she believes that Ace is in danger and goes there to warn him. Joe suffers further prejudice at the hands of openly hostile Colonel Crawford, pulling extra duty and all the less attractive assignments. When Joe and others who are married to Japanese are targeted for transfer back to the United States , Joe realizes that he will not be able to take Katsumi, who is now pregnant. Ace goes to General Webster and pleads Joe's case, asking that he be allowed to remain in Japan. When the General refuses on the grounds that he cannot allow an exception, Ace says that he will be in the same situation, since he intends to marry Hana-ogi. Eileen and her mother are present for the exchange, and Ace apologizes for hurting her. Eileen realizes Ace never loved her the way he loves Hana-ogi and leaves to see Nakamura. Joe and Katsumi's home is raided up by the military police and Ace is taken into custody by General Webster, where he is confined to quarters. He is told that he will most likely be sent back to the United States and Hana-ogi will be sent to Tokyo . Joe goes AWOL , and two Military Police seek Ace's help to find Joe through his local connections so he can be sent back to the U.S. and not be reported missing, which could lead to charges ranging from deliberately missing a movement — a serious offense in wartime — all the way to desertion . Ace, accompanied by Captain Bailey, finds Joe and Katsumi who had secretly returned to their home and committed double suicide rather than be parted. Hana-ogi later arrives unnoticed and alone outside Joe and Katsumi's home. There, she opens a window and, still unseen, whispers a tearful \"sayonara\" to Joe, Katsumi, and Ace, although nobody hears her. Hana-ogi then leaves through the rear gate. After exiting Joe's home, Ace and Bailey are attacked by Japanese holding anti-American signs. However, sympathetic Japanese neighbors intervene to help the Americans, resulting in widespread fighting in the street. Ace and Bailey escape during the scuffles. The loss of Joe and Katsumi strengthens Ace's resolve to marry Hana-ogi, and Ace goes to the theater company to find her. There, he learns Hana-ogi has already left Kobe for Tokyo a week ahead of schedule. General Webster, believing the crisis with Ace is averted, apologizes for what happened to Joe and Katsumi and says that laws will soon be passed to allow interracial marriages in the United States. Ace leaves Kobe and flies to Tokyo. He tracks down Hana-ogi at her new venue in a Tokyo theater and pleads with her again to become his wife. They leave the theater and Hana-ogi announces to the waiting Japanese and American reporters that they intend to wed. When a military newspaper reporter asks Ace how he will explain his marriage to the \"big brass\" as well as to the Japanese, Ace says, \"Tell 'em we said, 'Sayonara.'\"",

Lieutenant Kip, a Sikh sapper in the British Indian Army posted with Sergeant Hardy to clear German mines and booby traps, joins them. David Caravaggio, a Canadian Intelligence Corps operative who was tortured during a German interrogation, also arrives there. He questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past. Over the days of the patient relating his story, Hana and Kip begin a love affair. In the late 1930s, Hungarian cartographer László Almásy is exploring a region of the Sahara as part of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition group, which includes his good friend Englishman Peter Madox, and British couple Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who provide aerial surveys using their plane. Almásy discovers through a Bedouin the location of the ancient Cave of Swimmers , containing cave paintings. As the group documents their findings, Almásy and Katharine fall in love. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which she discovers when he awkwardly accepts two watercolours of the cave walls and asks her to paste them into the book. Upon returning to Cairo, they begin an affair, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys her a silver thimble as a gift. Geoffrey secretly watches her from his car and realizes that she is cheating. Months later, Katharine breaks things off, fearing the repercussions from Geoffrey. The archaeological projects are then halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his Tiger Moth airplane at Kufra Oasis before his return to Britain. Caravaggio now seeks revenge for his injuries, so far killing the German interrogator who had his thumbs cut off and the spy who identified him but now seeks whoever provided maps to the Germans, allowing them to infiltrate Cairo. He suspects Almásy, asking \"Did you kill the Cliftons?\", to which Almásy concedes \"Maybe ... I did\". Almásy tells Caravaggio, with Hana listening nearby, about packing camp in 1941 when Geoffrey arrives in the biplane. He aims at Almásy, who jumps out of the way, and crashes. Almásy finds Geoffrey dead at the controls and Katharine badly injured in the front seat. It was an attempted double murder-suicide, as he uncovered their affair. Almásy carries Katharine to the Cave of Swimmers and observes that she is still wearing the thimble that he had given her as a gift on a chain. She declares that she has always loved him. Leaving her there with provisions and his book, Almásy walks three days across the desert. At British-held El Tag , he explains her desperate situation and asks for help, but a young officer detains him on suspicion of being a spy. Transported away by train, Almásy escapes and eventually comes across a German army unit. They take him to the Kufra Oasis, where Madox has hidden his plane. Exchanging maps for fuel, Almásy flies to the cave and finds Katharine dead. Taking her on the plane, they are burned when shot down. After hearing the story, Caravaggio gives up his quest for revenge. Kip is reposted once he has cleared the explosives; he and Hana agree that they will meet again. Later, Almásy tells her that he has had enough by pushing vials of morphine towards her. Though distraught, Hana grants his wish, administering the lethal dose. As he drifts to sleep, she reads him Katharine's final letter, written while alone in the cave. The next morning, Hana goes with Caravaggio to Florence, holding Almásy's book tightly as they ride away.",

    "plot": "In 48 BC, Cleopatra vies with her brother Ptolemy for control of Egypt. Pothinos kidnaps her and Apollodorus and strands them in the desert. When Pothinos informs Julius Caesar that the queen has fled the country, Caesar is ready to sign an agreement with Ptolemy when Apollodorus appears, bearing a gift carpet for the Roman. When Apollodorus unrolls it, Cleopatra emerges, much to Pothinos' surprise. He tries to deny who she is. Caesar sees through the deception, and Cleopatra soon beguiles Caesar with the prospect of the riches of Egypt and India. Later, when they are seemingly alone, she spots a sandal peeking out from underneath a curtain and thrusts a spear into the hidden Pothinos, foiling his assassination attempt. Caesar makes Cleopatra the sole ruler of Egypt, and begins an affair with her. Caesar eventually returns to Rome with Cleopatra to the cheers of the masses but Roman unease is directed at Cleopatra. Cassius , Casca , Brutus and other powerful Romans become disgruntled, rightly suspecting that he intends to abolish the Roman Republic and make himself emperor, with Cleopatra as his empress (after divorcing Calpurnia ). Ignoring the forebodings of Calpurnia, Cleopatra, and a soothsayer who warns him about the Ides of March , Caesar goes to announce his intentions to the Senate. Before he can do so, he is assassinated. Cleopatra is heartbroken at the news. At first, she wants to go to him, but Apollodorus tells her that Caesar did not love her, only her power and wealth, and that Egypt needs her. They return home. Bitter rivals Marc Antony and Octavian are named co-rulers of Rome. Antony, disdainful of women, invites Cleopatra to meet with him in Tarsus , intending to bring her back to Rome as a captive. Enobarbus , his close friend, warns Antony against meeting Cleopatra, but he goes anyway. She entices him to her barge and throws a party with many exotic animals and beautiful dancers, and soon seduces him. Together, they sail to Egypt. King Herod , who has secretly allied himself with Octavian, visits the lovers. He informs Cleopatra privately that Rome and Octavian can be appeased if Antony were to be poisoned. Herod also tells Antony the same thing, with the roles reversed. Antony laughs off his suggestion, but a reluctant Cleopatra, reminded of her duty to Egypt by Apollodorus, tests a poison on a condemned murderer to see how it works. Before Antony can drink the fatal wine, however, they receive news that Octavian has declared war. Antony orders his generals and legions to gather, but Enobarbus informs him that they have all deserted out of loyalty to Rome. Enobarbus tells his comrade that he can wrest control of Rome away from Octavian by having Cleopatra killed, but Antony refuses to consider it. Enobarbus bids Antony goodbye, as he will not fight for an Egyptian queen against Rome.  A short montage sequence shows the fighting between the forces of Antony and Octavian, ending in the naval Battle of Actium . Antony fights on with the Egyptian army, and is defeated. Octavian and his soldiers surround and besiege Antony and Cleopatra. Antony is mocked when he offers to fight them one by one. Without his knowledge, Cleopatra opens the gate and offers to cede Egypt in return for Antony's life in exile, but Octavian turns her down. Meanwhile, Antony believes that she has deserted him for his rival and stabs himself. When Cleopatra returns, she is heartbroken to find him dying. They reconcile before he perishes. Then, with the gates breached, Cleopatra kills herself with a venomous snake and is found sitting on her throne, dead.",

    "plot": "Due to a cold , retired schoolteacher Mr. Chipping misses a first-day assembly at Brookfield public school for the first time in 58 years. That afternoon, he falls asleep in his chair and his teaching career is related via flashback . When 25-year-old Charles Edward Chipping first arrives as a Latin teacher in 1870, he becomes a target of practical jokes on his first day. He reacts by imposing strict discipline in his classroom, making him disliked but respected. Twenty years pass and he becomes the senior master. He is disappointed in not receiving an appointment as a housemaster within the school for the following year. However, the new German teacher, Max Staefel, saves him from despair by inviting him to share a walking holiday to his native Austria . While mountain-climbing, Chipping encounters Kathy Ellis, a feisty English suffragette who is on a cycling holiday with a friend. They meet again in Vienna , where she persuades him to dance to the Blue Danube Waltz . (This piece of music is used as a leitmotif , symbolizing Chipping's love for her.) Staefel remarks that the Danube does not appear blue, but Chipping remarks it only appears so to those who are in love. On another part of the same boat, as Kathy looks at the river, she tells her friend that it is blue. Even though Kathy is considerably younger and livelier than Chipping, she loves and marries him. They return to England, where Kathy takes up residence at the school, charming everyone with her warmth. During their tragically short marriage (she dies in childbirth, along with their baby), she brings \"Chips\" out of his shell and shows him how to be a better teacher. He acquires a flair for Latin puns . As the years pass, Chips becomes a much-loved school institution, developing a rapport with generations of pupils; he teaches the sons and grandsons of many of his earlier pupils. In 1909, when he is pressured to retire by a more \"modern\" headmaster, the boys and the board of governors of the school take his side of the argument and tell him he can stay until he is 100, and that he is free to pronounce Cicero as SIS-er-ro, and not as KEE-kir-ro. Chips finally retires in 1914 at the age of 69, saying, \" Haec olim meminisse iuvabit \" (One day, we'll look back on this and smile), but is summoned back to serve as interim headmaster because of the shortage of teachers resulting from the First World War . He remembers Kathy had predicted he would become headmaster one day. During a bombing attack by a German Zeppelin , Chips insists that the boys keep on translating their Latin, choosing the story of Julius Caesar 's battles against Germanic tribes, which describes the latter's belligerent nature, much to the amusement of his pupils. As the Great War drags on, Chips reads aloud into the school's Roll of Honour every Sunday the names of the many former boys and teachers who have died in the war. Upon discovering that Max Staefel has died fighting on the German side, Chips reads out his name in chapel, too. He retires permanently in 1918 but continues living nearby. He is on his deathbed in 1933 when he overhears his colleagues talking about him. He responds, \"I thought I heard you say it was a pity—pity I never had any children. But you're wrong. I have!

He agrees to defend Leonard Vole, despite Nurse Plimsoll's objections and Sir Wilfrid's doctor having warned against taking stressful criminal cases. Leonard is accused of murdering Emily French, a wealthy, childless widow who fell in love with him and named him as the main beneficiary in her will. Sir Wilfrid speaks with Leonard's German wife, Christine, whom he finds cold and self-possessed; she provides a not entirely plausible alibi. During the trial in the Old Bailey , the Crown introduces testimony that Mrs. French had seen Leonard with a younger woman and planned to confront him, but Sir Wilfrid believes his client to be innocent. He is shocked when Christine is called to give evidence against Leonard as a prosecution witness. While a wife cannot be compelled to testify against her husband , it is revealed that her marriage to Leonard is invalid, as she was already married to another man, Otto Helm, still alive and living in Germany. She states that she never loved Leonard, and her conscience compels her to tell the truth. She explains that she had a marriage ceremony with Leonard, a Royal Air Force sergeant serving in Berlin's British occupation zone , solely to escape from Soviet-controlled territory to the West. According to her testimony, Leonard confessed that after being confronted by Mrs. French, he had killed her to avoid being disinherited from her will. While fearing his client will be convicted and sentenced to hang , Sir Wilfrid is unexpectedly contacted by a woman who offers to sell him letters written by Christine to a lover named Max. The handwriting is genuine, and the woman has a legitimate reason for providing the letters: her lover attacked and disfigured her face. During cross examination, Sir Wilfrid reads the letters, which disclose a conspiracy between Max and Christine to frame Leonard. The jury acquits Leonard. Sir Wilfrid's worries prove justified when Christine, brought into the courtroom to protect her from the departing crowd, explains how she won the acquittal. After Sir Wilfrid had previously told Christine that a jury would not believe a loving spouse's alibi, she posed as a hateful, double-crossing wife. She also wrote letters to a non-existent lover (Max) and impersonated the disfigured woman who gave Sir Wilfrid the letters to discredit her own testimony. Christine loves Leonard, but knew he was guilty. Christine told the truth about the murder in the witness-box: Leonard did confess to her. Christine overhears Leonard gleefully boasting that he manipulated and murdered Mrs. French. Sir Wilfrid, who had believed in his client's innocence, is outraged. However, due to English double jeopardy laws, no further legal action can be taken against Leonard. Leonard says he is having an affair with the much younger woman seen by Mrs. French, and intends to abandon Christine. He smugly states that though Christine will be tried for perjury , he and she are now even, having saved each other's lives. A devastated Christine grabs a knife and fatally stabs Leonard. As she is arrested, Sir Wilfrid decides to further delay his retirement to defend Christine.",

The Schlegels are an intellectual family of Anglo-German bourgeoisie , while the Wilcoxes are conservative and wealthy, led by hard-headed businessman Henry. Helen and Paul quickly decide against the engagement, but she has already sent a telegram informing her sister Margaret, leading to an uproar when the sisters' Aunt Juley arrives and causes a scene. Months later in London, the Wilcoxes take a flat across the street from the Schlegels, whom they had met the previous year in Germany, and Margaret resumes her acquaintance with Ruth, Henry's wife. Howards End is owned by Ruth, and is her beloved childhood home, inherited from her family. The two women grow close as Mrs. Wilcox's health declines and, unbeknownst to Margaret, Ruth bequeaths Howards End to her on her death bed. However, the Wilcoxes refuse to believe Ruth would leave the house to a relative stranger and burn her informally-written directions. Henry develops an attraction to Margaret, assisting her in finding a new home and eventually proposing marriage, which she accepts. The Schlegels have befriended Leonard Bast, a self-improving young clerk who lives with Jacky, a woman of dubious origins. The sisters pass along advice from Henry to the effect that the insurance company Leonard works for is heading for bankruptcy. As a result Leonard quits and settles for a much lower-paying job, which is eventually eliminated so he has no employment. Helen is later enraged to learn Henry's advice was wrong; Leonard's first employer was perfectly sound but will not re-employ him. Months later, Henry and Margaret host the wedding of his daughter Evie at his Shropshire estate. Margaret is shocked when Helen arrives with the impoverished Leonard and Jacky. Considering Henry responsible for their plight, Helen demands his help, but Jacky drunkenly exposes Henry as a former lover from years ago. Henry is ashamed to be revealed as an adulterer , but Margaret forgives him and agrees to send the Basts away. Helen, upset with Margaret's decision to marry a man she now loathes, leaves for Germany, but not before giving in to her attraction for Leonard and having sex while out boating. Fearing the Basts will be penniless, Helen instructs her brother Tibby to give them over £5000 of her own money, but Leonard returns the cheque uncashed out of pride, and because of his own feelings for Helen. Margaret and Henry marry, arranging to use Howards End as storage for Margaret's and her siblings' belongings. After months of hearing from Helen only through postcards, Margaret grows concerned. Helen returns to England when Aunt Juley falls ill, but avoids seeing her family. Believing Helen is mentally unstable, Margaret lures her to Howards End to collect her belongings, arriving herself with Henry and a doctor, and finds Helen is pregnant. Insisting on returning to Germany to raise her baby alone, Helen asks to stay the night at Howards End but Henry adamantly refuses, leading to an argument with Margaret. Leonard, still living unhappily in poverty with Jacky, has a dream about how he first met Helen. Discovering that he wants to see her again, he travels to Howards End, arriving to find a very pregnant Helen, Margaret, and Henry's brutish eldest son, Charles. Realising Leonard is the baby's father, Charles assaults him for \"dishonouring\" Helen, and a bookcase collapses on Leonard, who dies of a heart attack. Margaret tells Henry that she is leaving him to help Helen raise her baby, and Henry breaks down, telling her the police inquest will charge Charles with manslaughter.

He employs a second nurse, but fires her after he discovers she is mistreating Anne. One day, Georges sits next to Anne's bedside and tells her a story of his childhood, which calms her. As Anne closes her eyes, he quietly picks up a pillow and smothers her to death. Georges returns home with bundles of flowers in his hands, which he proceeds to wash and cut. He picks out a dress from Anne's wardrobe and writes a long letter. He tapes the bedroom door shut and catches a pigeon that has flown in through the window. In the letter, Georges explains that he has released the pigeon. Georges imagines that Anne is washing dishes in the kitchen and, speechless, he gazes at her as she cleans up and prepares to leave the house. Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following her out of the door. The film concludes with a continuation of the opening scene, with Eva seated in the living room after wandering around the now-empty home.",

    "plot": "In 1913, Houston , eight-year-old Howard Hughes ' mother gives him a bath and teaches him how to spell \"quarantine\", warning him about the recent cholera outbreak. Fourteen years later, in 1927, he begins to direct his film Hell's Angels , and hires Noah Dietrich to manage the day-to-day operations of his business empire. After the release of The Jazz Singer , the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the result and orders it to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn , who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and germaphobia . In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer , pushing it to a new speed record, despite having to crash-land into a beet field when the aircraft runs out of fuel. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) . Juan Trippe , company rival and chairman of Pan Am , gets his crony, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster , to introduce the Community Airline Bill , which would give Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. Hepburn grows tired of Hughes' eccentricity and workaholism, and leaves him for fellow actor Spencer Tracy . Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue , and later actress Ava Gardner . However, he still has feelings for Hepburn, and bribes a reporter to keep reports about her and the married Tracy out of the press. In the mid-1940s, Hughes contracts two projects with the Army Air Forces , one for a spy aircraft , and another for a troop transport unit for use in World War II . In 1947, with the H-4 Hercules flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight; he crashes in Beverly Hills and is severely injured, but miraculously survives. The army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. Dietrich informs Hughes that he must choose between funding the airlines or his flying boat. Hughes orders Dietrich to mortgage the TWA assets so he can continue the development. As his OCD worsens, Hughes becomes increasingly paranoid, planting microphones and tapping Gardner's phone lines to keep track of her, until she kicks him out of her house. The FBI searches his home for incriminating evidence of war profiteering , searching through his possessions. Brewster privately offers to drop the charges if Hughes sells TWA to Trippe, but Hughes refuses. Hughes' OCD symptoms become extreme, and he retreats into an isolated \" germ -free zone\" for three months. Trippe has Brewster summon him for a Senate investigation, certain that Hughes will not show up. Gardner visits him and personally grooms and dresses him in preparation for the hearing. An invigorated Hughes defends himself against Brewster's charges and accuses the Senator of taking bribes from Trippe. He concludes by announcing that he has committed to completing the H-4 aircraft, and that he will leave the country if he cannot get it to fly. Brewster's bill is promptly defeated. After successfully flying the aircraft, Hughes speaks with Dietrich and his engineer, Glenn Odekirk , about a new jetliner for TWA. However, he begins hallucinating men in germ-resistant suits, and has a panic attack . As Odekirk hides him in a restroom while Dietrich fetches a doctor, Hughes begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his love for aviation and his ambition for success, compulsively repeating the phrase \"the way of the future\".",

    "plot": "The Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball have difficulty fielding competitive teams due to low revenue and owners who are reluctant to spend money. General manager Billy Beane drafts and develops cheap, young, and talented players, [ a ] but the Athletics lose the 2001 American League Division Series (ALDS) to the New York Yankees , baseball's richest and most successful team. [ b ] For the 2002 season , Beane is given a paltry $41 million budget. [ c ] Through free agency , three richer teams poach three of Beane's best players: Jason Giambi , Johnny Damon , and Jason Isringhausen . Adding insult to injury, Giambi joins the Yankees. Beane is skeptical about traditional baseball scouting methods after the New York Mets drafted him in the first round of the 1980 draft —prompting Beane to decline a Stanford scholarship—only for Beane to have an unimpressive playing career. Beane tries to trade for the Cleveland Indians ' Karim García , but Cleveland refuses on the advice of team advisor Peter Brand, a Yale economics graduate who privately complains to Beane that Cleveland rarely takes his advice, and expresses a belief that baseball teams focus too much on individual players to have success. Intrigued, Beane asks whether Brand would have drafted him in 1980. After Brand reluctantly admits that he would not have drafted Beane until the ninth round, Beane hires Brand. Beane and Brand study sabermetrics , an unconventional scouting philosophy. Unable to afford more talented, expensive players, Beane and Brand focus on maximizing the team's on-base percentage (OBP) and compromise on skills like base stealing , defense, and batting average . They acquire undervalued players like aging David Justice , injured catcher Scott Hatteberg , and submariner Chad Bradford . Beane fires head scout Grady Fuson , who refuses to abandon his traditional scouting methods. A poor start to the season prompts the media and the team to question Beane's philosophy. Manager Art Howe , who is angling for a contract extension, disregards Brand's advice to put the players with the best OBP at the top of the batting order . Howe resists playing Hatteberg at first base, so Beane forces Hatteberg into the lineup by trading away Howe's favored first baseman Carlos Peña . Although Jeremy Giambi has good on-base skills, Beane decides that Giambi lacks the intangible qualities to succeed and trades him as well. [ d ] Beane persuades team owner Stephen Schott to trust in the plan. With Cleveland performing poorly, Beane devises a trade for the Indians' star reliever Ricardo Rincón . The Athletics' performance improves, placing them on the verge of an AL -record-breaking 20th consecutive win . Although Beane rarely attends games, his daughter Casey persuades him to attend the next game against the Kansas City Royals . Oakland leads 11–0 when Beane arrives, but the Royals mount a furious comeback and tie the game. Hatteberg hits a walk-off home run to the Oakland fans' delight. Despite the celebration, Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have changed baseball by winning the World Series . The Athletics are the 2002 American League West champions but lose to the Minnesota Twins in the first round of division playoffs . A media analyst asserts that the Athletics lost because they lacked intangible qualities that cannot be measured with statistics. However, Boston Red Sox owner John W. Henry realizes that the Athletics lost primarily because of random chance and their small budget. He offers Beane $12.5 million—the largest contract for a general manager in history—to take over the Red Sox organization. Tempted by the opportunity to implement his ideas on a larger budget, Beane discloses Henry's offer to Brand and says that their strategy failed. Brand shows Beane a video of batter Jeremy Brown , who hits a home run, but does not realize it. Sensing the meaning of the video and what Brand is trying to say, Beane thanks Brand. A subplot in the film explores Beane's relationship with his ex-wife Sharon and estranged daughter Casey, an aspiring singer and guitar player. In the final scene, Beane is driving while listening to a burned CD of Casey singing \" The Show \", prompting him to cry. An epilogue reveals that Beane turned down the offer from Boston, but the Red Sox used sabermetrics to win the 2004 World Series , prompting other teams to embrace Beane's philosophy.",

Seeking stardom, Roxie begins an affair with furniture salesman Fred Casely, who claims to know the manager. After the show, Velma is arrested for killing her husband and sister upon catching them in bed together. A month later, Casely admits to Roxie that he lied about his connections in order to sleep with her. Enraged, she shoots him dead. She convinces her gullible husband, Amos, to take the fall by telling him she killed a burglar in self-defense. However, when evidence of Roxie's infidelity is uncovered, Amos recants and tells the police that Casely was dead when he arrived home (\"Funny Honey\"). Roxie is arrested, with District Attorney Martin Harrison declaring she faces execution by hanging. At Cook County Jail , Roxie is sent to Murderess' Row, supervised by the corrupt Matron \"Mama\" Morton (\"When You're Good to Mama\"). She learns the backstories of the other women there, including her idol Velma (\" Cell Block Tango \"), who rebuffs her attempts at friendship. On Morton's advice, Roxie engages Velma's lawyer, the brilliant Billy Flynn (\"All I Care About\"). Flynn and Roxie manipulate the press, reinventing Roxie as an originally virtuous Southern woman corrupted by the city's decadent nightlife; she claims that she had the affair with Casely because Amos was always working, but repented and left Casely for Amos, and Casely jealously attacked her (\"We Both Reached for the Gun\"). The press believe the story; praised by the public as a tragic heroine, Roxie becomes an overnight sensation (\"Roxie\"). Velma, unhappy at losing the public's attention, tries to convince Roxie to join her act, replacing her murdered sister (\"I Can't Do It Alone\"), but Roxie, now the more popular of the two rivals, snubs her. When wealthy heiress Kitty Baxter is arrested for murdering her husband and his two mistresses, the press and Flynn instantly shift their focus to her. To Velma's surprise, Roxie quickly regains the spotlight by claiming pregnancy. Amos is ignored by the press (\"Mister Cellophane\"), and Flynn, to generate more sympathy for Roxie, convinces him that the child is Casely's, and that he should divorce Roxie in the midst of her predicament. Roxie decides to fire Flynn, believing she can now win on her own. However, when Katalin Helinszki, a Hungarian woman on Murderess' Row (the only inmate who insists on her own innocence), becomes the first woman in Cook County history to be executed by hanging, Roxie realizes the gravity of the situation and rehires Flynn. Roxie's trial begins, and Flynn turns it into a media spectacle (\"Razzle Dazzle\") with the help of sensationalist newspaper reporters and radio personality Mary Sunshine. Flynn discredits witnesses, manipulates evidence and even stages a public reconciliation between Amos and Roxie when she claims the child is his. The trial seems to be going well for Roxie until Mama and Velma are listening to the trial and find Roxie's diary, and bring it to court, reading incriminating entries in exchange for amnesty in her own case. Flynn discredits the diary, implying from its legalistic language that it was written by Harrison, who planted it as evidence (\"A Tap Dance\"). Roxie is acquitted, but her fame is eclipsed moments later when another woman, who had also shot her own husband, shoots her lawyer outside the courthouse. Flynn admits to Roxie that he tampered with her diary himself, in order to incriminate the DA and also free two clients simultaneously. Amos remains loyal and excited to be a father, but Roxie cruelly reveals that she faked her pregnancy. Roxie continues to pursue a vaudeville career, with limited success (\"Nowadays\"). The similarly unsuccessful Velma reapproaches Roxie to suggest performing together as a double act consisting of two murderers. Roxie initially refuses, but later accepts when Velma points out that they can perform together despite their mutual resentment. The two stage a spectacular performance (\"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\"), receiving a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience that includes Flynn, Morton, the jurors, and other acquitted murderesses.",

Mankiewicz , who is in Victorville, California , recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash. Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character ( Charles Foster Kane ) and William Randolph Hearst . Producer John Houseman is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Herman's brother Joseph worries that it may anger the powerful Hearst. In 1930, Herman visits an MGM location where he and the female lead, Marion Davies , recognize each other. She introduces him to Hearst, her benefactor and lover, who takes a liking to Herman. In 1933, Herman and his wife Sara attend Louis B. Mayer 's birthday party at Hearst Castle with many Hollywood bigwigs. They discuss the rise of Nazi Germany and the upcoming gubernatorial election , in particular candidate Upton Sinclair . Herman and Marion go for a stroll, where they bond over discussions on politics and the film industry . In 1940, Houseman grows impatient over Herman's lack of progress. Rita is also concerned with the timing of the writing and Herman's alcoholism . He does finish the screenplay in time. Houseman is impressed but reminds Herman that he will receive no credit for his work. In 1934, Herman and Joseph begin working at MGM under Mayer. Studio executives, including Irving Thalberg , actively work against Sinclair's gubernatorial campaign . The studio produces propaganda films for a smear campaign , funded by Hearst, against Sinclair (the films were an ironic suggestion by Herman after a discussion on why he wouldn't publicly endorse Frank Merriam , Sinclair's Republican opponent in unity with Mayer and the studio's brass).  Herman approaches Marion to pull the films but is unsuccessful as she has already left the studio for Warner Bros. Herman and Sara later attend an election night watch party at the Trocadero Nightclub , where Mayer announces the winner, Frank Merriam. Herman's colleague, director Shelly Metcalf, shoots and kills himself after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and guilt-ridden about the role he played in the smear campaign (he personally supported Sinclair). In 1940, Charles Lederer picks up the screenplay from Herman to deliver to the studio. Joseph visits Herman after reading it, warning him of Hearst's reaction and how it might affect Marion. He does, however, believe that it is the finest thing Herman has ever written. Marion also visits and does her best to persuade Herman to change the screenplay but to no avail. She tells Herman she will try to stop the picture from getting made. In 1937, Herman crashes a party at Hearst Castle, where he drunkenly attacks Hearst for not supporting Sinclair as Sinclair supported Hearst as a champion of Socialism in his youth as a budding newspaper magnate.  Offending everyone present, including Hearst, Mayer, and Marion, an enraged Mayer reveals that Herman is on Hearst's payroll and calls him a court jester . Hearst tells him an allegory about a monkey and an organ grinder and sees him out. In 1940, despite pressure from Hearst, Welles is determined to make the film and intends to do a re-write without Herman. He visits Herman and offers him a buyout from the studio. However, reneging on the terms of his contract and with the Screen Writers Guild having been recently revived, Herman requests credit for the script, declaring it his greatest work. An upset Welles tells Herman that he has gone to bat for him before leaving angrily. Herman ultimately receives joint credit with Welles, and they win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film ( Citizen Kane ) two years later.",

Met with scepticism, he makes a £ 20,000 wager (worth about £2.3 million today [ 5 ] ) with four fellow members of the Reform Club (each contributing £5,000 to the bet) that he can make the journey and arrive back at the club eighty days from exactly 8:45 pm that evening. Together with his resourceful French valet , Passepartout , Fogg goes hopscotching around the globe generously spending money to encourage others to help him get to his destinations faster so he can accommodate tight steamship schedules. Having reached Paris they hear that a tunnel under the Alps is blocked. The Thomas Cook agent who assists them offers to hire or sell them his gas filled balloon. Fogg buys it and they fly over the Alps drinking champagne. Blown off-course, the two accidentally end up in Spain, where we see a table-top flamenco sequence performed in a bar. Later, Passepartout engages in a comic bullfight. Next, they go to Brindisi in Italy. Meanwhile, back in London, suspicion grows that Fogg has stolen £55,000 (around £6.2 million today [ 5 ] ) from the Bank of England so Police Inspector Fix is sent out by Scotland Yard to trail him (starting in Suez ) but must keep waiting for a warrant to arrive so he can arrest Fogg in the British-controlled ports they visit.

Reaching New York , they arrange their passage on a cargo steamship travelling to Venezuela – Fogg bribes the captain to go to England. Alas, they run out of coal mid-ocean and the ship stops. Fogg buys the ship and then instructs the crew to take everything that burns, including lifeboats, to provide fuel.

Loretta's boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri, proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to tend to his dying mother.

Loretta insists that they talk privately. They go to Ronny's apartment, where Loretta cooks a meal, and both have several alcoholic beverages. Loretta compares Ronny to a wolf that would gnaw off its paw to escape a trap and claims he deliberately injured his hand to escape a bad relationship.

    "plot": "In the 1750s, Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the eastern Paraguayan jungle to convert the Guaraní to Christianity. He sends another priest to make contact with them, but the man is thrown to his death from Iguazu Falls . Father Gabriel travels to the falls and plays his oboe . One of the Guaraní grabs the oboe from his hands and breaks it in half. Father Gabriel does not react, and the remaining Guaraní, captivated by the music, take him to their village. Captain Rodrigo Mendoza is a mercenary and slave trader, and a guest of the Spanish governor, Don Cabeza. His fiancée Carlotta confesses that she is in love with his brother Felipe. After Mendoza catches them sleeping together and kills Felipe in a duel , an act that leaves him riddled with guilt. Father Gabriel, a friend of the governor's, challenges Mendoza to undergo penance . Mendoza is forced to accompany the Jesuits to their mission while dragging his heavy armor and sword behind him. The natives recognise their persecutor, but soon forgive a tearful Mendoza. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní. Moved by the Guaraní's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help, and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit. With the protection offered under Spanish law, the Jesuit missions have been safe. The newly signed Treaty of Madrid reapportions land on which the missions are located, transferring it to the Portuguese . The Portuguese have no interest in converting the natives, viewing them as animals fit only for slavery. Aware that the Jesuits would likely oppose such efforts, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a Jesuit, is sent to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain. Under pressure from both Cabeza and the Portuguese emissary Hontar, Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if in favour of the missions, the Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese , and the Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their success in converting the native peoples. At Father Gabriel's mission, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the missions and instructs the Guaraní that they must leave because \"it is God's will\". The Guaraní question this and argue that God's will is to develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication , state their intention to defend the mission even at the cost of their lives. They are, however, divided on how to do it. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, by contrast, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the Guaraní the European art of war. When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, Mendoza and a Guaraní militia resist them. Their heroic defense is quickly overcome by the superior weaponry and numbers of the enemy. After breaking through and mortally wounding Mendoza soldiers encounter the Jesuits of the mission leading the Guaraní women and children singing in a religious procession. Father Gabriel is at the head, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament . The colonial forces organize a firing line and discharge their guns directly into the procession, killing the priests. After Mendoza sees Father Gabriel die before succumbing to his own wounds, a Guaraní man picks up the Blessed Sacrament and continues to lead the procession. Most of the natives are subsequently captured to be sold as slaves, but a small group of children manages to escape into the jungle. In a final exchange between Altamirano and Hontar, the latter notes that what has happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\" Altamirano rejoins: \"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\" Days later, a canoe carrying the surviving children returns to the pillaged and burned mission, retrieving their belongings and departing up the river.",

One day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion to defend her husband, US Army Lieutenant Frederick \"Manny\" Manion, who has been arrested for the murder of innkeeper Bernard \"Barney\" Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, which suggests he may be eligible for a defense of irresistible impulse —a version of a temporary insanity defense. It is strongly implied that Manion is faking insanity, having been guided to it as a potential defense by Biegler. Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that keeps the judge busy maintaining control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially as local district attorney Mitch Lodwick is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer from the Attorney General's office. Furthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During cross-examination , Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked her, a Catholic , to swear on a rosary that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was consensual. Quill's estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant, whom Dancer accused of being Quill's mistress. McCarthy learns that Pilant is in fact Quill's daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette, the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion. During the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her underwear while raping her; the underwear was not found where she alleged the rape took place. Pilant, previously unaware of any details of the case, hears this during the trial and then tells Biegler and later testifies that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room the morning after the alleged rape. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the laundry chute located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant's answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant's lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found not guilty by reason of insanity. After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner. The next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions' trailer park home to get Manion's signature on a promissory note which they hope will suffice as collateral for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was \"an irresistible impulse\", the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quill's estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be \" poetic justice \".",

    "plot": "In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of the Bronx . After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1919–1930 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica , Sayer discovers stimuli that will \"awaken\" the patients from their respective catatonic states. Actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, being called by their name, and enjoying human touch each have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Patient Leonard Lowe seems to remain unmoved, but Dr. Sayer learns that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board. After attending a lecture at a conference on the drug L -DOPA and its success for patients with Parkinson's disease , Sayer believes that the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results; Leonard completely \"awakens\" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors, so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L -DOPA medication and gain \"awakenings\" to reality and the present. Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula, the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard begins to chafe at the restrictions placed on him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. As Leonard becomes more agitated, Sayer notices that a number of facial and body tics begin to manifest , which Leonard has difficulty controlling. Although Dr. Sayer and the hospital staff are initially overjoyed by the success of L-DOPA in reviving a group of catatonic patients, they soon realize that the effects are only temporary. Leonard, the first to \"awaken\", is also the first to show signs of decline. His tics gradually worsen, his walk becomes a shuffle, and he begins to experience full-body spasms that severely limit his movement. Despite the pain, Leonard remains resolute. He asks Dr. Sayer to film him, hoping that his experience may one day contribute to research that helps others. Aware of his deteriorating condition, Leonard shares a final lunch with Paula. He tells her that he can no longer see her, but before parting ways, she invites him to dance. While they dance, Leonard's spasms cease for a brief, calming moment. Although Leonard and Sayer reconcile, Leonard soon returns to a catatonic state. One by one, the other patients follow, despite increasing doses of L-DOPA. Dr. Sayer speaks to a group of hospital donors, explaining that while the physical awakenings were fleeting, a deeper awakening had occurred, with most a renewed sense of appreciation for life. Sayer also grows from the experience, finally overcoming his intense shyness to ask Nurse Eleanor Costello for coffee. The staff now treats the patients with greater empathy and dignity, and Paula continues to visit Leonard. Although Leonard is again unresponsive, he and Sayer maintain their connection through the Ouija board, a quiet testament to the enduring human spirit.",

Her lawyer, Ed Masry , expects to win, but Erin's explosive courtroom behavior under cross-examination loses her the case, and Ed will not return her phone calls afterwards. One day, he arrives at work to find her in the office, apparently working. She says that he told her things would work out and they did not, and that she needed a job. Ed takes pity on Erin, and she gets a paid job at the office. Erin is given files for a real estate case where the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is offering to purchase the home of Donna Jensen, a resident of Hinkley, California . Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&E correspondence together. Donna appreciates PG&E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has Hodgkin's lymphoma , but PG&E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, \"because of the chromium\". Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is seriously contaminated with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium , but PG&E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium. After several days away from the office doing this research, she is fired by Ed until he realizes that she has been working the entire time, and sees what she has found out. Rehired, she continues her research, and over time, visits many Hinkley residents and wins their trust. She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the \"safe\" chromium. The Jensens' claim for compensation grows into a major lawsuit, but the direct evidence only relates to PG&E's Hinkley plant, not to corporate management. Knowing that PG&E could slow any settlement for years through delays and appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration, but a large majority of the plaintiffs must agree to this. Erin returns to Hinkley and persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along. While she is there, a man named Charles Embry approaches her to say that he and his cousin were PG&E employees, but his cousin recently died from the poison. The man says he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&E, but, \"as it turns out,\" he \"wasn't a very good employee\". Embry gives Erin the documents, which include a 1966 memo proving corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret. The judge orders PG&E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs. In the aftermath, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case but warns her he has changed the amount. She explodes into a complaint that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it—to $2 million.",

Rosa, whose husband died in the Vietnam War , is raising her young son, Sonny, on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay on condition that he does not drink while working. During quiet evenings, they sit alone and share parts of their life stories. Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After enough days of keeping his word and doing his work, he is comfortable enough in his new life that he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. A newspaper reporter eventually visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and if he has deliberately chosen to lead an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about him and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott, a country music star who is performing nearby. After the story is published, the neighbourhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Despite greeting them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert.

David Lee, the oldest son, is a bright boy who loves to hunt with his father, Nathan Lee, and their dog Sounder, but is only able to attend school sporadically in between helping his mother Rebecca on the farm. Nathan and David lose the raccoon they are hunting one evening, leaving the family without meat to eat, but the children awaken the next morning to the smell of ham cooking and happily eat it. When they return home after a community baseball game, which Nathan helps his team win, they find the sheriff and his deputies waiting to arrest Nathan for stealing the ham from a nearby smokehouse . As they take him away, Sounder runs after their wagon and one of the deputies shoots him, though Nathan partially deflects the shot by kicking the gun. The injured Sounder runs away, and David cannot find him. He looks for him for days, but is unable to continue the search because with their father gone, he and his little brother and sister must help Rebecca farm and harvest the crops. Rebecca shares her faith with David that Sounder is alive and will return home eventually. Nathan was sentenced to one year hard labor. The family is restricted from visiting Nathan at the local jail while he awaits shipment to the work camp. Only David is allowed to visit, and he brings a chocolate cake that Rebecca baked for Nathan, and they enjoy a piece together despite their worries over not knowing where Nathan will be taken. Mrs. Boatwright, a sympathetic local woman who employs Rebecca to do her laundry and often gives the children books to read, promises David she will find out the location of the work camp Nathan has been taken to. When the sheriff refuses to tell her, she goes through his filing cabinet to find the information. Despite the sheriff's threats, she tells the Morgan family that Nathan has been taken to the distant Wishbone prison camp and helps Rebecca plot the route there on the map.

After returning home, David longs to attend the distant school, but has largely given up on the dream when one day Sounder runs barking like he used to, to greet the returning Nathan, who was released from the work camp early after his leg was injured in a dynamite explosion. Seeing his father's depleted strength, David resolves to stay and work the farm in his place, but after learning of the school, Nathan is adamant that David go to attend it full-time. They have a heart-to-heart about how Nathan wishes for his children to escape the dead-end life of sharecropping and aspire to better things, and the next day, Rebecca and his siblings cheerfully see David off as Nathan takes him away to attend the school, accompanied by Sounder.",

When the helpful inmate is let out of solitary, he escapes by switching places with a corpse on the way to the morgue. He makes his way to the bookstore run by the newcomer's beautiful sister. She recognizes him. She manages to get his gun and starts to call the police, but then changes her mind and gives him back his pistol. The escaped inmate (who has been attracted to her since he saw the newcomer's photograph) gets a job and becomes better acquainted with her and her family. They all like him, especially his sister. However, he is caught and sent back to prison. When the menacing inmate tells the helpful inmate of his plan for a jailbreak on a holiday, the helpful inmate tells him that he is going straight. In return for a promise of freedom, the newcomer informs the warden of the attempt, though he is not privy to the details. Despite the warning, the inmates succeed in taking over the prison, capturing many of the guards, though they are unable to force their way out. Thwarted, the menacing inmate threatens to shoot the guards one by one unless they are allowed to escape. When the warden stands firm, the menacing inmate shoots the warden's right-hand man in cold blood, then tosses the dying man out for all to see. Military vehicles are called to break down the entrance. The helpful inmate grabs a pistol from the prisoner assigned to watch the guards. He finds the newcomer cowering with the guard but spares him. The newcomer panics and flees before the helpful inmate locks the guards in to save their lives. When the newcomer tries to open the front doors, he is killed in the crossfire. The menacing inmate is told that the helpful inmate was the informant who tipped off the warden and learns he has put the guards out of danger. He sets out to kill his former friend. In the ensuing gunfight, both are wounded, the menacing inmate fatally. Before he dies, he learns that the newcomer was actually the informer, and he and the helpful inmate reconcile. For his efforts, the helpful inmate is given a full pardon. When he exits the prison, his sister rushes to embrace him."

    "plot": "Evelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond. Two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, Evelyn is enduring multiple struggles: the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); Waymond is attempting to serve her with divorce papers in an effort to spark a discussion about their marriage; her rigorous father (referred to as Gong Gong , Cantonese for grandfather ) [ 10 ] is visiting for her Chinese New Year party; and she has a strained relationship with Joy, who is battling depression [ 11 ] and has a non-Chinese girlfriend, Becky, whom Evelyn is reluctant to accept. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] At a tense meeting with IRS Revenue Agent Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the \"Alphaverse.\" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist (the \" multiverse \") because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. In the Alphaverse, the now-deceased Alpha-Evelyn developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki, the Alpha-Joy whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to verse-jump beyond her endurance. Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. Jobu has created a black hole -like \" Everything Bagel \" [ 14 ] that forms a toroid singularity [ 15 ] that could destroy the multiverse. Evelyn is provided verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who are converging on the IRS building. She uncovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star. She also learns that Waymond intends to file for divorce. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, possesses the untapped potential needed to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to prevent Jobu from using her to access Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by acquiring powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind begins to splinter, causing her to collapse. Evelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across many bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu discloses she does not intend to fight, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters. She teleports Evelyn to the Everything Bagel, divulging that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the Bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and behaves cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her. Just as Evelyn enters the Bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead practice kindness, even when life is senseless. Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist [ 16 ] and humanitarian advice, utilizing her multiverse powers to fight with empathy [ 17 ] and bring happiness to those around her. In doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and divulges it to Gong Gong, while Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the Bagel alone as, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy pleads with Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she will always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the Bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace. Sometime later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.",

    "plot": "Dr. Constance Petersen is a psychoanalyst at Green Manors, a mental hospital in Vermont , accused by an unsuccessful suitor colleague of being icy and unemotional. The hospital's director, Dr. Murchison, is forced into retirement shortly after returning from an absence due to nervous exhaustion. His replacement, Dr. Anthony Edwardes, turns out to be surprisingly young. Uncharacteristically, Petersen is immediately smitten with Edwardes, who returns her feelings. While kissing him, Petersen notices that Edwardes has a peculiar phobia about sets of parallel lines against a white background, displayed on several occasions. She compares his signature with an autographed copy of one of his books, realizing when they do not match that he is an impostor. He confides to her that he has killed the real Edwardes, who was treating him, and taken his place. Suffering from amnesia, he does not know who he really is, but they deduce that he is a doctor when he displays medical knowledge. Petersen believes he is an innocent man with a guilt complex . Overnight, he disappears. Edwardes' assistant arrives and discloses that the Edwardes who spoke to her on the phone is an impostor, and that the real Edwardes is ominously missing. Petersen tracks the impostor to a New York City hotel, where he is living under the pseudonym \"John Brown\". Despite his insistence that she leave, she convinces him that psychoanalysis can recover his memories. The two travel to Rochester, New York , and stay with Dr. Alexander Brulov, Petersen's former mentor and friend. The two psychoanalysts interpret a dream that \"Brown\" describes. He is playing cards in a mysterious club when a scantily clad woman resembling Petersen starts kissing everybody there. His card partner, an older man, is accused of cheating and threatened by the club's masked proprietor. The scene changes to the older man standing on the precipice of a sloped roof and falling off. The proprietor is found to be standing behind a chimney and dropping a wheel he held in his hand. \"Brown's\" dream concludes with him chased down a hill by a great pair of wings. \"Brown's\" phobia of dark lines on white represents ski tracks in the snow, and the older man in his dream is the real Edwardes, who died in a skiing accident. The detail of the wings they deduce to represent Gabriel Valley ski lodge. \"Brown\" and Petersen travel there to recreate the circumstances of Edwardes' death. However, \"Brown\" fears that, if he really was Edwardes' murderer, he may impulsively kill again in the same situation. As they ski down the slope, \"Brown\" remembers details of his former life: he has a guilt complex, rooted in a childhood accident where he accidentally killed his brother by sliding down a concrete banister and knocking him onto a spiked fence. He also recognizes the cliff where Edwardes fell off, and then \"Brown\" recalls his own real name: John Ballantyne. Petersen and Ballantyne later meet with the police, who find Edwardes' body with Ballantyne's directions. However, the corpse has a bullet wound in his back. Ballantyne is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder. Heartbroken, Petersen returns to Green Manors. Murchison, once again the director, lets slip that he knew Edwardes slightly and disliked him, contradicting his earlier statement that they had never met. This inspires Petersen to re-examine her notes of Ballantyne's dream: the masked proprietor represents Murchison and the wheel represents a revolver. Murchison therefore murdered Edwardes and left the gun on the ski slope. Confronting Murchison to prove her hunch, Petersen gets him to admit that the man in the dream likely represents himself. She presents her accusation, and Murchison replies that she got every detail right but one: he still has the revolver and draws it on her. Calmly, Petersen points out that while he could plead insanity and get a lesser charge for Edwardes' murder, shooting her in cold blood would guarantee his execution. With the gun still pointed at her, she leaves the office to phone the police, before Murchison turns the gun and shoots himself. Petersen and Ballantyne, now married, receive well-wishes from Dr. Brulov before departing on their honeymoon at Grand Central Terminal .",

Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend to the herd. Doubtful of the rifle's purported range, the two decide to test it out, aiming at rocks and highway traffic. Yussef manages to hit a bus, critically wounding an American woman who is traveling with her husband on vacation. [ 7 ] The two boys flee the scene and hide the rifle in the hills. Glimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Abdullah, who has heard about the shooting, asks the boys where the rifle is and beats the truth out of them. Finally, the three try to flee but are spotted. The police corner the father and boys on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, severely injuring him.

The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, still waiting for transport to a hospital. A helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in Casablanca , where she is expected to recover. Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia, tends to their children, Debbie and Mike, in their San Diego , California home.

Rather than staying the night at the party, Amelia drives back to the States with her nephew, Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all of them, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Under pressure, Santiago speeds away in a drunken panic and abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, whereupon awakening in the morning they soon begin to suffer from heat exhaustion. Amelia leaves the children behind to find help, ordering them not to move. She eventually finds a Border Patrol officer, who places her under arrest. They travel back to where she left the children, but they are not there.

She invites one of the detectives, Kenji Mamiya (真宮 賢治 Mamiya Kenji ), back to the high-rise apartment that she shares with her father. Incorrectly assuming that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off the balcony and that she witnessed this herself. The detectives are actually investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him. He resists her approaches but comforts her as she bursts into tears. Leaving the apartment, Mamiya crosses paths with Yasujiro and questions him about the rifle. Yasujiro explains that there was no black market involvement; he gave his rifle as a gift to Hassan, his hunting guide on a trip in Morocco. About to depart, Mamiya offers condolences for the wife's suicide.

The Boeing 707 aircraft gets stuck in the snow, and its tail sticking out results in that runway's closure. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife Cindy. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, customer relations agent Tanya Livingston. Pilot Vernon Demerest is scheduled to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during TGA Flight 2 to Rome, aboard the airline's flagship international service - The Golden Argosy . Despite being married to Bakersfeld's sister Sarah, Demerest is having an affair with Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child. They consider abortion, but Gwen has moral qualms about such a procedure and expresses the excitement she felt upon being told of her pregnancy. Bakersfeld calls in senior mechanic Joe Patroni to assist with removing the snowstuck plane. He and Tanya also deal with Ada Quonsett, an elderly widow from San Diego who is a habitual stowaway on various airlines. Bakersfeld also clashes with commissioner Ackerman, who wishes to close the alternate runway 22 (and thus the entire airport) due to noise complaints from nearby residents. Former U.S. Army Corps of Engineers demolition expert Dominic (D.O.)

He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while they fly over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect $225,000 of insurance. His erratic behavior at the airport, including mistaking a Customs officer for a gate agent, attracts officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs officials that he had been fired from a construction job for \"misplacing\" explosives and that the family's financial situation is dire. Ada Quonsett manages to evade the employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles. Enchanted by the idea of a trip to Rome, she talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2 and sits next to Guerrero. When Flight 2's crew is made aware of Guerrero's situation, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once the stowaway widow is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew --- with the promise to her of a free lifetime travel-voucher --- to get to the briefcase, but the ploy fails. Demerest tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy has been nullified. Guerrero moves to give Demerest the bomb, but then runs into the lavatory and sets it off, dying and blowing a three-foot hole in the rear fuselage. Gwen and some other passengers are seriously injured in the explosion and subsequent explosive decompression , but the pilots retain control of the 707. However, flight control is severely hindered due to the blast damage. With all eastern airports closed due to bad weather, Flight 2 returns to Lincoln for an emergency landing . Demerest knows that a fatal crash landing would happen if they attempt to land on the shorter Runway 22, and thus demands the airport's longest runway, Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Bakersfeld orders that plane be sacrificed and forcibly pushed off by snowplows. However, Patroni goes ahead and manages to free the stuck aircraft without damage by defying the specified engine and structural limit requirements, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled Flight 2 to land. His assistant declares that the feat was \"impossible\" according to the manual, to which Patroni replies \"That's one nice thing about the 707. It can do everything but read.\" As the passengers exit, a tearful Inez apologizes for her husband's actions. Demerest's wife sees him accompanying Gwen's stretcher as he intends to go with Gwen to the hospital. Demerest has by now decided he wants her to go through with her pregnancy. Ada Quonsett enjoys her reward of free first-class travel on TGA. Bakersfeld and Tanya leave together, heading to her apartment for \"rest\" and breakfast.",

The police tell Mildred her first husband, Bert Pierce, is guilty of the murder, because he owned the gun, had a motive, and does not deny the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind to commit murder and reveals her story to the officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. After Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay, Mildred must sell her baked goods to support the family. Bert accuses Mildred of favoring their two daughters over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they separate. Mildred retains custody of 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for high social status and is ashamed of her mother being a baker. Mildred hides her other job as a waitress, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with disdain. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy with an almost-depleted inheritance. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house for a weekend, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip to Lake Arrowhead with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With help from her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is successful. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California. Veda secretly marries well-to-do Ted Forrester for his money and position, but his mother objects. Veda agrees to dissolve the marriage but claims she is pregnant and demands $10,000 (equivalent to $192,000 in 2024) from the Forresters. Veda smugly confesses her pregnancy is a sham to Mildred, who tears up the check and throws her out of the house. Bert, too distraught to tell Mildred about Veda's latest escapade, takes her to Wally's nightclub, where Veda performs as a lounge singer. After seeing several sailors in the audience wolf-whistle at Veda in her sexy costume, Mildred begs her to come home. Veda sneers and says her mother can never give her the lifestyle she deserves. Desperate to reconcile with her daughter, Mildred coaxes Monte into a loveless marriage to improve her social status, with Monte's price being a one-third share of her business to allow him to settle his debts. Veda, eager to live out her dream as a debutante, pretends to reconcile with her mother and moves into Beragon's lavish mansion. Eventually, the cost of supporting Monte and Veda's affluent lifestyles—and Monte's underhanded ploy to retain his share in the business while causing his wife to forfeit her own—bankrupts Mildred, forcing her to sell the restaurant chain. After driving to his beach house to confront Monte, Mildred finds Veda in his arms. Veda scornfully tells her mother that Monte intends to marry her after divorcing Mildred, who runs to her car in tears after dropping a gun she intended to use on Monte. When Monte tells Veda he would never marry her because she is a \"rotten little tramp\", she shoots him with Mildred's gun. Veda begs her mother to help conceal the murder; Mildred reluctantly agrees. Fed up with Wally's misdeeds—helping Veda blackmail the Forresters, hiring her to sing in his seedy nightclub, assenting to Monte's business move against her, and making constant sexual overtures toward her—Mildred tries to pin the murder on Wally by luring him to the beach house. Police officers arrest Wally when he flees in panic after seeing Monte's body. Still, the investigating officer tells Mildred that Wally cannot be the killer because he has no motive. In the present, the detectives admit they knew all along that Veda committed the murder. Mildred tries to apologize as her daughter is sent to jail, though Veda claims that she will get by.

On Christmas Eve, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry, a Navy fighter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a kamikaze attack on a troopship. Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 ($139,726 in 2024 ) of the building and loan's money. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, but absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter's newspaper. Potter keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it.

    "plot": "In 1907 a young Englishwoman, Lucy Honeychurch, and her cousin and chaperone , Charlotte Bartlett, stay at the Pensione Bertolini while on holiday in Florence . They are disappointed that their rooms lack a view of the River Arno as promised. At dinner they meet other English guests: the Reverend Mr. Beebe; two elderly spinster sisters, the Misses Alan; romance author Eleanor Lavish; the freethinking Mr. Emerson; and his quiet, handsome son George. Learning about Charlotte and Lucy's disappointment at not having a view of the river, Mr. Emerson and George offer to exchange rooms, though Charlotte considers the suggestion indelicate. Mr. Beebe mediates and the switch is made. While touring the Piazza della Signoria the next day, Lucy witnesses a local man being brutally stabbed and killed. She faints but George Emerson appears and comes to her aid. When Lucy has recovered, the two have a brief but unchaperoned discussion before returning to the pensione. Later Charlotte, Lucy and the Emersons join other British tourists for a day trip to the Fiesole countryside. The carriage driver canoodles with his girlfriend, sitting beside him, which upsets Reverend Eager, who insists the girlfriend get off the carriage in the middle of the countryside. Wishing to engage in gossip unsuitable for Lucy, Charlotte and Miss Lavish encourage her to go for a walk; Lucy goes looking for Mr. Beebe. The Italian driver, possibly misunderstanding Lucy's awkward Italian or possibly mischievously playing Cupid , instead leads her to where George Emerson is admiring the view from a hillside. Seeing Lucy across a poppy field, he suddenly embraces and passionately kisses her. Charlotte appears and intervenes. Worried that Lucy's mother will consider her an inadequate chaperone, Charlotte swears Lucy to secrecy and cuts their trip short. Upon returning to Surrey in England , Lucy says nothing to her mother about the incident and pretends to forget it. She is soon engaged to Cecil Vyse, a wealthy and socially prominent man who is cold, snobbish, and pretentious. Cecil loves Lucy, but he and his mother consider the Honeychurch family their social inferiors, which offends Mrs. Honeychurch. Lucy soon learns that Mr. Emerson is moving into Sir Harry Otway's rental cottage, with George visiting at weekends. Lucy intended the two Misses Alan to live there and is cross with Cecil on learning that through a chance meeting with the Emersons in London, Cecil recommended the cottage to them. He proclaims his motive was to annoy Sir Harry, whom Cecil considers a snob; he assumes Harry will find the Emersons “too common\". George's presence upends Lucy's life, and her suppressed feelings for him surface. Cecil, her fiancé, asks her permission to kiss her, then does so awkwardly. Lucy’s non sequitur comment that the people she met in Italy were “extraordinary” invites a comparison to the impromptu passionate kiss she received from George. Meanwhile, Lucy's brother, Freddy, becomes friends with George. Freddy invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner, the Honeychurch home, during which Cecil reads Miss Lavish's latest novel set in Italy. As Cecil mockingly reads aloud to Lucy and George, they recognize a scene as being identical to their encounter in the poppy field in Fiesole. Cecil, still reading, is oblivious when George passionately kisses Lucy in the garden. She confronts Charlotte, who admits to telling Miss Lavish about the kiss in the poppy field, which was then used in her story. Lucy orders George to leave Windy Corner and never return. He says that Cecil sees her only as a possession and will never love her for herself, as he would. Lucy seems unmoved, but soon after ends her engagement to Cecil, saying they are incompatible. To escape the ensuing fallout, Lucy arranges to travel to Greece with the Misses Alan. George, unable to be around Lucy, arranges for his father to move to London, unaware that Lucy is no longer engaged. When Lucy calls at Mr. Beebe's home to fetch Charlotte, she is confronted by Mr. Emerson, who happens to be there. She finally realizes and admits her true feelings for George. At the end, newlyweds George and Lucy honeymoon at the Italian pensione where they met, in the room with a view, overlooking Florence's Duomo .",
