  "plot": "It is 1183 in the medieval Angevin Empire . Fifty-year-old Henry II of England seeks to establish a line of succession and summons his family for Christmas at his castle in Chinon , Touraine . He wants his youngest son, John , to inherit his throne, while his estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine , reprieved from imprisonment in England by Henry for the holiday, favours their eldest surviving son, Richard , a proven warrior. Henry invites Philip II of France , son and successor of Louis VII , Eleanor's first husband, to settle some business. Louis had made a treaty with Henry pledging Philip's half-sister Alais , currently Henry's mistress, in troth to Henry's future heir; Philip demands either a wedding or the return of her dowry , the strategically important county of Vexin near Paris. Henry agrees to give Alais to Richard to wed and make him heir-apparent in return for Eleanor surrendering the Duchy of Aquitaine . She wishes to keep to John, buying with her gift her freedom. When the arrangement is revealed at the wedding, Richard, who coveted the Aquitaine himself, refuses to go through with the marriage – just as Henry anticipated. Perceiving treachery in Henry's ploy, John is manipulated by his middle brother, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany , to plot with Philip to make war on Henry in return for being named John's chancellor. Richard then plots with Philip while John and Geoffrey hide behind a curtain. Henry and Philip meet to discuss terms, with all three princes in hiding. Philip reveals that he had been caballing with John and Geoffrey, then with Richard separately, and that he and Richard may once have been lovers. Philip casts their romantic liaison as always having been a scheme. Richard emerges and decries this, but Philip, saying he had always loathed Richard's sight and touch, turns the knife deeper. Recognizing his sons' limitations and plottings against him, Henry dismisses all three as unsuitable heirs and endungeons them. He readies a train to travel to Rome to demand an annulment of his marriage to Eleanor by the Pope, intending then to wed and have new sons with Alais. She protests that he will never be able to release his treasonous offspring from prison as they will slay any new heir. Henry recognizes the peril to his plan and confronts all three sons at once. Condemning them to death, he raises his sword over Richard but brings the blade down harmlessly upon Richard's shoulder. Weeping, he lets the threesome escape. Realizing his hopes are lost, and that he has been checked by Eleanor, he is resigned and falls pitifully into her arms. In the morning, she leaves on her barge, waving while he bellows cheerful nonsenses, each realizing their love for one another. They will resume their jousting next year.",
