  "plot": "German gunners shoot down a British biplane flying across a desert. A group of Bedouin pulls the badly burned pilot from the wreckage, rescuing him. Hana, a French-Canadian WWII Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps combat nurse, discovers from a wounded soldier that her boyfriend has been killed. In October 1944 Italy , she is caring for a dying, severely burned English-accented patient who says that he cannot remember his name. His only possession is a copy of Herodotus's Histories , with personal notes, pictures, and mementos stored inside. When a nurse friend is killed in front of her, Hana decides that she is a curse to her loved ones. She gains permission to settle in a bombed-out monastery with her patient, as he is suffering during their hospital unit's relocation. Lieutenant Kip, a Sikh sapper in the British Indian Army posted with Sergeant Hardy to clear German mines and booby traps, joins them. David Caravaggio, a Canadian Intelligence Corps operative who was tortured during a German interrogation, also arrives there. He questions the patient, who gradually reveals his past. Over the days of the patient relating his story, Hana and Kip begin a love affair. In the late 1930s, Hungarian cartographer László Almásy is exploring a region of the Sahara as part of a Royal Geographical Society archeological and surveying expedition group, which includes his good friend Englishman Peter Madox, and British couple Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who provide aerial surveys using their plane. Almásy discovers through a Bedouin the location of the ancient Cave of Swimmers , containing cave paintings. As the group documents their findings, Almásy and Katharine fall in love. He writes about her in notes folded into his book, which she discovers when he awkwardly accepts two watercolours of the cave walls and asks her to paste them into the book. Upon returning to Cairo, they begin an affair, while the group arranges for more detailed archaeological surveys of the cave and the surrounding area. Almásy buys her a silver thimble as a gift. Geoffrey secretly watches her from his car and realizes that she is cheating. Months later, Katharine breaks things off, fearing the repercussions from Geoffrey. The archaeological projects are then halted due to the onset of the war. Madox leaves his Tiger Moth airplane at Kufra Oasis before his return to Britain. Caravaggio now seeks revenge for his injuries, so far killing the German interrogator who had his thumbs cut off and the spy who identified him but now seeks whoever provided maps to the Germans, allowing them to infiltrate Cairo. He suspects Almásy, asking \"Did you kill the Cliftons?\", to which Almásy concedes \"Maybe ... I did\". Almásy tells Caravaggio, with Hana listening nearby, about packing camp in 1941 when Geoffrey arrives in the biplane. He aims at Almásy, who jumps out of the way, and crashes. Almásy finds Geoffrey dead at the controls and Katharine badly injured in the front seat. It was an attempted double murder-suicide, as he uncovered their affair. Almásy carries Katharine to the Cave of Swimmers and observes that she is still wearing the thimble that he had given her as a gift on a chain. She declares that she has always loved him. Leaving her there with provisions and his book, Almásy walks three days across the desert. At British-held El Tag , he explains her desperate situation and asks for help, but a young officer detains him on suspicion of being a spy. Transported away by train, Almásy escapes and eventually comes across a German army unit. They take him to the Kufra Oasis, where Madox has hidden his plane. Exchanging maps for fuel, Almásy flies to the cave and finds Katharine dead. Taking her on the plane, they are burned when shot down. After hearing the story, Caravaggio gives up his quest for revenge. Kip is reposted once he has cleared the explosives; he and Hana agree that they will meet again. Later, Almásy tells her that he has had enough by pushing vials of morphine towards her. Though distraught, Hana grants his wish, administering the lethal dose. As he drifts to sleep, she reads him Katharine's final letter, written while alone in the cave. The next morning, Hana goes with Caravaggio to Florence, holding Almásy's book tightly as they ride away.",
