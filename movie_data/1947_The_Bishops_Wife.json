  "name": "The Bishop's Wife",
  "plot": "Bishop Henry Brougham, having difficulties finding the funding for the building of a new cathedral , prays for divine guidance. His plea is seemingly answered by a suave angel named Dudley, who reveals his heavenly identity only to the clergyman. Dudley's mission turns out, however, not to be to help construct a cathedral, but to guide Henry and the people around him spiritually. Henry has become obsessed with raising funds, to the detriment of his family life. His relationships with wife Julia and their young daughter Debby are strained by his focus on the cathedral. Everyone, except for Henry, is charmed by Dudley, even the non-religious Professor Wutheridge. When Dudley spends time cheering up Julia, though, an unexpected development occurs: he finds himself strongly attracted to her. Sensing this, Henry becomes jealous and anxious for his now unwelcome guest to finish and depart. He reveals Dudley's true identity to Professor Wutheridge, who urges him to stand up and fight for the woman he loves. Dudley persuades a wealthy parishioner, the widowed Agnes Hamilton, to contribute her much needed funds, but not to build the cathedral, as Henry had hoped. Instead, he coaxes Mrs. Hamilton to donate her money to feed and clothe the needy, much to Henry's chagrin. On several occasions throughout the film, Dudley is shown to have special powers as an angel . He helps Julia and Sylvester (a taxi driver) ice skate like pros, redecorates the Broughams' Christmas tree in seconds, saves an old church by restoring interest in the boys' choir, dictates to a typewriter to magically produce Henry's new sermon —without Henry's knowledge— and other smaller things. Eventually, Dudley hints to Julia his desire to stay with her and not move on to his next \"assignment\". Although Julia doesn't fully understand what he's talking about, she senses what he means and tells him it is time for him to leave. Dudley tells the bishop it is rare for an angel to envy a mortal. When Henry wants to know why his cathedral plans were derailed, Dudley reminds the Bishop that he had prayed for guidance, not a building. With his mission completed and now knowing that Julia loves her husband, Dudley leaves, promising never to return, but satisfied that his work is done. All memories of him are erased, and later that Christmas Eve at midnight, Henry delivers the sermon he believes he has written.",
