  "plot": "In 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression , the noted Broadway producers Jones and Barry are staging Pretty Lady , a musical starring Dorothy Brock. She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon, the show's financial backer, but she is secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner Pat Denning, who is out of work. Julian Marsh is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is impoverished following the 1929 Stock Market Crash , so he must make his last show a hit in order to earn enough money to retire. Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition. The newcomer Peggy Sawyer is ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming and Ann Lowell, take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with the dance director, Andy Lee, and she ensures that Ann and Peggy are chosen. Peggy is tricked into bursting into the dressing room of the show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler, who takes an immediate liking to her. When Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy to intimidate Pat. Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. Pat takes a stock job in Philadelphia . Rehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's surprise opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning, Abner has quarreled with her and wants Marsh to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. Annie confesses that she cannot carry the show but convinces the director that the inexperienced Peggy can. Julian is desperate and rehearses Peggy mercilessly until an hour before the premiere. Billy finally musters the nerve to tell Peggy that he loves her. They embrace and kiss, just as Dorothy appears and walks through the door. She wishes Peggy luck and reveals that she and Pat are finally getting married. The show is staged to rousing applause. As the theater audience leaves, Julian stands in the shadows outside the stage door, hearing comments that Peggy is the star and that he does not deserve the credit for the show's success. [ 6 ]",
