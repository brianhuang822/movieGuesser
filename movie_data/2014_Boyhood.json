Mason overhears Olivia arguing with her boyfriend, saying she has no free time due to parenting. The following year, Olivia and the children move to Houston so she can attend the University of Houston to get a better job. Mason's father, Mason Sr., visits Houston in 2004 and takes Mason and Samantha bowling. When he drops the children off at home, he argues with Olivia while the kids watch from a window. Olivia takes Mason to one of her classes, and introduces him to her professor, Bill Welbrock; Mason sees them flirt. In 2005, Olivia and Bill have married and blended their two families. They share experiences such as playing video games and attending a midnight release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . Mason and Samantha are enrolled in the same school as their step-siblings, Mindy and Randy. There, Mason befriends Nicole, who has a crush on him. The next year, Mason and Samantha bond with their father as he takes them out for a day in Houston, culminating in a Houston Astros game and a sleepover at his house. Olivia continues her education and is initially supportive of Bill's strict parenting style, which includes many chores for the children and an enforced shaving of Mason's long hair. In 2007, Bill gradually becomes abusive and violent towards Olivia and the children due to his alcoholism . After he assaults Olivia, she moves out with Mason and Samantha to a friend's house and files for divorce. Her step children stay with their father, since Olivia is unable to locate their biological mother. Next, when Mason Sr. learns that Samantha has a boyfriend, he talks to her and Mason about contraception. He also has them assist him in volunteering for Barack Obama's presidential campaign , to mixed results from the suburban Texas residents. Then on a camping trip with his son, they connect through music, film, and Mason's blossoming interest in girls. The teens have grown into their lives in San Marcos , a town close to Austin. In 2009, Mason is bullied at school and playfully teased on a camping trip, but starts receiving attention from girls. Olivia takes a position teaching psychology at college and moves in with Jim, a student and Iraq War veteran. The next year, Mason is now in high school and experiments with marijuana and alcohol . Mason Sr., who has remarried and has a baby, has become more religious and takes his kids to visit his wife's parents. For Mason's 15th birthday, Mason Sr. gives him a suit and CDs; Mason's step-grandparents give him a Bible and a shotgun. In 2011, Mason is lectured by his photography teacher, who sees his potential but is disappointed by his lack of ambition. He later attends a party and meets Sheena, who becomes his girlfriend. After Mason arrives home late one night from a party, a drunk Jim confronts him about his late hours. Olivia and Jim subsequently break up, and the family's financial situation worsens. The following year, Mason and Sheena visit Samantha, who is attending the University of Texas at Austin , where they share their hopes and fears about college. They have sex, and Samantha's roommate discovers them asleep together in her dorm bed. In 2013, towards the end of Mason's senior year in high school, he has a painful breakup with Sheena, wins the second-place silver medal in a state photography contest, and is awarded college scholarship money. His family throws him a graduation party and toasts his success. Mason Sr. gives him advice about his breakup. Planning to sell the house and downsize, Olivia meets Samantha and Mason for lunch and asks them to sort through their possessions. Later that year, as Mason prepares to leave for college, Olivia breaks down, disillusioned by how quickly life has passed. At Sul Ross State University in Alpine , Mason moves into his dorm and meets his new roommate Dalton, Dalton's girlfriend Barb, and Barb's roommate, Nicole. Mason is given an edible by Barb, and the group goes hiking at Big Bend Ranch State Park .
