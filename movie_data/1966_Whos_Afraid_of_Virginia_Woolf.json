  "name": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?",
  "plot": "George, an associate professor of history at a small New England college, and his wife Martha, the daughter of the university president, return home drunk from a party. Martha has invited a young married couple she met at the party for a drink. The guests arrive—Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey—just before 2:30 a.m. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in back and forth scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later entangled. Martha angers George by telling Honey about their son, who will celebrate his 16th birthday the next day. Martha's divulging of this information sets off another fight between the two and the women leave the room. Alone with George, Nick confesses that he was attracted to Honey for her family's money and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and, years later, his father and lived out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits that he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start. When their guests propose leaving, a drunken George insists on driving them home. They approach a roadhouse , and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Martha suggestively dances with Nick while continually mocking George. George finally unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished novel, prompting George to physically attack Martha until Nick pulls him away. George comments that since they've already played \"humiliate the host\", they should try playing \"hump the hostess\" or \"get the guests\". He also mentions that he's written a second novel about a teacher and his wife who marry because of her false pregnancy and family money. Honey realizes Nick has told George about their past and runs from the room. Another argument leads Martha to drive off with Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot. He arrives to see the silhouettes of Martha and Nick together in the bedroom window and Honey distraught in the front yard. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real and that she secretly had an abortion . Inside, Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, which he blames on the large amount of liquor he has consumed. With the quartet together again, Martha and George resume arguing about their son,  with each making lurid accusations about how the other negatively affected him. George finally ends the back and forth by dramatically announcing that he has received a telegram saying their son has been killed in a car accident. As Martha begs George not to \"kill\" their son, Nick realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children and filled the void with an imaginary son. George explains that their one mutually agreed upon rule was to never mention the son to anyone else, and that he \"killed\" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey. The young couple departs awkwardly at dawn, leaving George and Martha alone. George starts singing the song \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", and Martha responds, \"I am, George, I am\", while the two hold hands.",
