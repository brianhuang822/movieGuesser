  "name": "The Wizard of Oz",
  "plot": "In rural Kansas , Dorothy Gale lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em and wishes she could be somewhere else. Her neighbor, Almira Gulch, who was bitten by Dorothy's dog, Toto , obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize him, but Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune teller, convinces her that Aunt Em is heartbroken, which prompts Dorothy to return home. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar , she takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious by the window. She seemingly awakens to find the house moving through the air, with her and Toto still inside it and various figures float by with Gulch turning into a witch. The house comes down in an unknown land, and Dorothy is greeted by a good witch named Glinda , who floats down in a bubble and explains that she has landed in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz , and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East , killing her. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West , suddenly appears, but before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers , Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City , the home of the Wizard of Oz , as he might know how to help her return home, before she floats away in her bubble. Along the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow , who wants a brain; the Tin Man , who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion , who wants courage. They reach the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. They are initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, who relents due to Dorothy's grief, and they are led into the Wizard's chambers. He appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broom. During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch's castle, but the ruby slippers protect her, and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards, the Winkies. She taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow's arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto him, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away. The Winkies gratefully give Dorothy the Witch's broom, and the group returns to the Wizard, but he tells them to come back the next day. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects a ghostly image of his face. They confront him, who insists he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" Dorothy's friends' wishes by giving them tokens to confirm that they had the qualities they sought. The Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take her back to Kansas with him aboard it, she accepts, but Toto jumps out of her arms and she goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda then floats down in her bubble and reappears before she walks over and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, she heeds Glinda's instructions by clicking her heels three times and repeating, \"There's no place like home.\" Dorothy awakens in her own bed in Kansas. She recounts her adventures, but Aunt Em says that she just had a bad dream. She tells Professor Marvel and the farmhands that they were in Oz also, and they smile, humoring her. As she hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, \"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\" [ 23 ]",
