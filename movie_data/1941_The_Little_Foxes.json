  "name": "The Little Foxes",
  "plot": "The Hubbards, a wealthy but corrupt family, are entertaining a dinner guest, William Marshall, a prominent Chicago businessman with whom they hope to partner in an enterprise to build a cotton mill in their sleepy Alabama town, called Paltou, taking advantage of low wages paid to workers. Marshall looks favorably on the plan and invites Regina Giddens to let him show her Chicago. After he leaves, Regina reveals that she plans to move to Chicago, taking her 17 year old daughter, Alexandra, with her. She plans to finally live the privileged life she believes she deserves, away from the backward place where they presently live. Regina, thoroughly scheming, proceeds to drive a hard bargain with her equally scheming brothers, Oscar and Ben, for a forty-percent share of the mill in exchange for persuading Horace to invest $75,000, only a one-third share. She sends Alexandra to Baltimore to bring her father home, supposedly because Regina misses him. When Alexandra accuses childhood friend, David Hewitt, a journalist for the local newspaper, of not liking anyone in her family, he teases her saying he likes one person — her papa. Bidding her farewell at the train station as she leaves to pick up her father, he instructs her to open her eyes to circumstances surrounding her and to “think for yourself.” On her trip, he encourages her to widen her world, speak to strangers, and go beyond the societal conventions for women. Realizing that she will resent him for revealing truths about her unsavory family, he gently prods her to increase awareness. On another occasion, when asked by Regina whether he is courting her daughter, David replies that at present he is not declaring his intention, but that if he decides to do so, he will not care whether or not she approves. Oscar, having married and abused the sweet-souled, fragile, now-alcoholic Birdie only to acquire her family's plantation , Lionnet, and its cotton fields, now schemes to consolidate the family wealth by a marriage between his son, Leo, and Alexandra, but neither Horace nor Regina like the idea. When Horace dislikes the proposal to invest in the cotton mill, Regina continues to press him, making him aware of her mercenary motives for asking him to return home. While the two of them argue upstairs, the brothers find an alternative. Leo, a teller at the bank, will “borrow” Horace's railroad bonds from his safe deposit box. They will use them as security for the construction, returning them long before it is time to clip the coupons . Gloating, Ben tells a furious and bewildered Regina they don't need her. Birdie, Alexandra, Horace, David, and Addie, the family's housekeeper have a little party while Regina is at David's mother's house, getting her dresses fitted. Birdie reveals that she drinks while realizing that she was miserably unhappy in her marriage, knowing Oscar married her for her family's land, and that she disliked her own son. Sobbing, Alexandra escorts Birdie back to her house. The next day, Horace checks the content of his safe deposit box in the Hubbard-owned bank, of which he is president, and finds that the bonds are missing. When Regina learns that her brothers have “borrowed” the bonds without permission, she threatens her brothers and nephew with exposure and sending them to jail unless they give her 75% of the venture’s profit. Quarreling alone with Regina, Horace intends to frustrate and punish his contemptuous wife’s scheming by claiming he lent her brothers the bonds. She would only be entitled to repayment of the loan without any share of the profits. He also announces that he has changed his will with the help of his attorney, Saul Fowler, leaving Regina with the bonds, while the rest of his estate would go to Alexandra. Regina spews her hatred for him, informing him that she never loved him and had grown contemptuous of his unquestioning acceptance of her constant excuses for rejecting his affections. During the quarrel, Horace suffers a heart attack, and Regina callously refuses him heart medication. Normally confined to a wheelchair, he collapses attempting to climb up a staircase to reach his medication while Regina makes no move to help. Only after he collapses, does she call her servants to help her bring him to his room. However, Horace dies soon after. Regina now forces her brothers to give her 75% ownership of the business, threatening to reveal their crimes to the local magistrate, and them being jailed. While Oscar is infuriated with the loss of the money and power that he so wanted, Ben takes the loss more philosophically, saying that he must accept it for now, but the situation may turn. For example, he might begin to ask what a man in a wheelchair was doing on a staircase. A bewildered Alexandra overhears this. “What was Papa doing on the staircase?” She asks her relatives. Alexandra becomes aware of her mother’s and uncles’ perfidy. She confronts her mother telling her that she wasn't going to stand by and watch people eat the earth and causing all kinds of hurt. Comforting her, David gently tells her that she had to learn the truth by herself; she would have resented anyone who told her about her family. Alexandra and David leave town and her poisonous family for a new life together. Regina is left utterly alone: her daughter has left, her husband has died on account of Regina's willful neglect, and her brothers are unable to be trusted.",
