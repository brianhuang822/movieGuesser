  "plot": "On the morning of Labor Day 1955, a freight train brings vagrant Hal Carter to the fictional town of Salinason, Kansas to visit his old fraternity friend Alan Benson from college. Hal meanders through the town until he gets to the backyard of kind elderly Helen Potts, who offers him breakfast after he offers to do some backyard work for her. Mrs. Potts tells Hal that Alan visits with Madge Owens, the young teenage girl next door. He meets her, her sister Millie, and their mother. He also briefly meets Rosemary the spinster schoolteacher who lives in a rented room next door and Bomber the newspaper boy who is a flirt who always hits on Madge and all the pretty girls in town. Madge is the town beauty queen and Millie is her book smart tomboyish younger sister. Their mother Florence is a stern single mother who raised her two daughters on her own after the girls’ father walked out on them. She wishes for nothing more than for her daughter to marry Alan since he comes from wealth; his father is very successful in the grain business. Madge meets Hal and tells him where he can find Alan. As their eyes lock Madge and Hal are instantly attracted to each other. \nAlan is happy to see the \"same old Hal\" and shows him his family's sprawling grain-elevator operations. He promises Hal a steady job as a \"wheat scooper\" (though Hal would prefer to start off as an executive) and invites him to attend the town's Labor Day picnic.\nMeanwhile Madge is getting ready for the picnic and having a talk with her mother who is urging Madge to marry Alan as they have been dating all summer and she wants to see her daughter financially stable in life. Millie and Madge fight as Millie is jealous of her sister’s looks and Madge is jealous of Millie’s book smarts. \nMadge and Millie accompany Alan and Hal to the local swimming spot and then get ready for the picnic. Millie tells the boys she believes Madge will be crowned the town beauty queen, the Queen of Neewollah (Halloween backwards). At the picnic, Hal divides his attention among Madge, Millie, Flo, Alan, Mrs. Potts and Rosemary, who is accompanied by her boyfriend Howard Bevans who owns a novelty shop. The gang competes in all the games at the festival and later on they relax on the lawn by the river with their picnic basket and get to know Hal better. Hal seems content with everyone and is interested in settling down in the town.  \nLater that night Madge is indeed crowned the town queen of Neewalloh and is to be formally crowned on Halloween. As she sails down the river on a boat during her celebratory coronation, the crowd cheers her on with Hal looking on in particular. Later on there is dancing at the pavilion and Millie tries dancing with Hal and Rosemary is now intoxicated from the liquor Howard brought. Madge and Hal begin dancing and dance gracefully for all. Rosemary is insanely jealous and pulls Hal away from Madge and attempts to dance with him. She then rips his shirt and starts to angrily berate Hal and angrily cries out that she can keep up with the young people. \nIn the meantime Millie has also become intoxicated from the same liquor.\nShe gets up, claiming to be sick. As Madge tries to help her, Millie pushes her away, saying everyone always thinks \"Madge is the pretty one.\"  She runs off, leaving Howard to find a bottle of alcohol she left behind, which her mother Flo inadvertently sees. When she wants to know who has been giving liquor to her underage daughter, Rosemary blames Hal. Embarrassed by the rejection, Rosemary also now continues to berate and blame Hal, telling him he's been acting like a big shot since he got into town and that he acts young, but isn't. She accuses him of being a fake who is just scared to act his real age, afraid of ending up in the gutter \"where you belong.\"\nFlo Alan and Mrs Potts tend to Millie while Madge follows Hal to Alan's car and gets in with him, trying to cheer him up. They drive off, with Hal in a bad mood after what Rosemary had told him. They park by the river, and he tells her he was sent to reform school as a boy for stealing a motorcycle and that his whole life is a failure. Madge feels for Hal and  they then kiss, realizing they have fallen for each other. Later on, Outside Madge's house, they promise to meet after she finishes work the next evening.\nMeanwhile Howard drives a tearful Rosemary home. Rosemary is tired of being single and begs Howard to marry her, and Howard says he will come over the next morning to discuss it. \nHal drives back to Alan's house to return his car, but Alan has called the police and wants him arrested. Alan is upset about the car but is more upset that he feels Hal is stealing his girl Madge. Hal flees the house in the car with the police following close behind. He shows up at Howard's apartment, asking to spend the night there hiding from the police. Howard is very understanding and now has his own worries since Rosemary has begged him to marry her. Back at the Owens house, Madge and Millie cry themselves to sleep in their shared room, with Millie swearing she will never drink again and Madge uncertain about her future with Hal. The next morning, Howard comes to the Owens house, intending to tell Rosemary he wants to wait, but at the sight of him she is overjoyed, thinking he has come to take her away. He wordlessly goes along with the misunderstanding and before he knows it Rosemary is getting ready to get married while Florence Mrs Potts Millie and Rosemary’s fellow schoolteachers are wishing the two congratulations on their upcoming wedding. As Howard passes Madge on the stairs, he tells her Hal is hiding in the back seat of his car. Hal is able to slip away before the other women gleefully decorate Howard's car, and Howard and Rosemary drive off to be married. While Howard and Rosemary happily drive off to the Ozarks for their honeymoon, Hal and Madge meet by a shed behind the house. He tells her that he loves her and asks her to meet him in Tulsa , Oklahoma where they can marry and he can get a job at a hotel as a bellhop and elevator operator. Mrs. Owens finds them by the shed and threatens to call the police on him but he tells her he’s leaving. Madge and Hal embrace and kiss. Hal runs to catch a passing freight train, crying out to Madge, \"You love me! You love me!\" Then he hops on the train and the train speeds off. Flo attempts to run after her crying daughter and turns to Mrs Potts for advice. Mrs Potts indicates she likes the young man for Madge and tries to tell Flo to let her daughter grow up and find out for herself about him. Upstairs in their room, Millie tells Madge to \"do something bright\" for once in her life and go to Hal to marry him. Madge packs a small suitcase and, despite her mother's begging and tears to stay, bids goodbye to Mrs Potts Millie and her mother and boards a bus for Tulsa to meet Hal.",
