  "plot": "In 1929 Lynchburg, Virginia , young Desmond Doss nearly kills his brother while roughhousing. That event and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment \" Thou shalt not kill \". Years later, he takes an injured man to the hospital and a romance develops with nurse, Dorothy Schutte. Desmond tells her of his interest in medical work. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brings the United States into World War II, Desmond enlists in the United States Army to serve as a combat medic . His father, Tom, a PTSD -ridden World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Shortly before leaving, Desmond and Dorothy get engaged. Desmond is placed in basic training with the 77th Infantry Division under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes a pariah among some of his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays . Howell and Captain Glover attempts to discharge Desmond for psychiatric reasons under Section 8 are overruled, as Desmond's religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Desmond with grueling labor tasks intended to drive him out. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, Doss refuses to identify his attackers, earning their respect. Desmond's unit completes basic training and is released on leave during which Desmond intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Desmond in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but he refuses to compromise his beliefs. He pleads not guilty at his court-martial but is found guilty. His father bursts into the tribunal before sentence can be pronounced with a letter from his former commanding officer, now a brigadier general , stating his son's pacifism is protected by the US Constitution . The charges are dropped, and Desmond and Dorothy are married. Desmond’s unit is deployed to the Pacific Theater . During the Battle of Okinawa , they are tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). The battle begins with heavy losses on both sides. Desmond saves the life of his squad-mate Smitty, who apologizes for doubting his courage. Desmond reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. When a Japanese counterattack drives the Americans off the escarpment, Smitty is killed, and Howell and several of Desmond’s comrades are left injured on the battlefield. Desmond hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The rescue of dozens of wounded who had been presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Desmond rescues Howell under heavy fire. Captain Glover apologizes for dismissing Desmond’s beliefs and states that they are scheduled to retake the ridge on Saturday but will not launch the next attack without him. Desmond agrees, but the operation is delayed until after he concludes his Sabbath prayers. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. In an ambush set by Japanese soldiers who pretend to surrender , Desmond saves Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades . He is wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Desmond is lowered from the cliff, clutching the Bible that Dorothy had given to him. The film closes with images of the real Desmond Doss being awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge, and an interview with Desmond just before his death, recounting his experiences during the war.",
