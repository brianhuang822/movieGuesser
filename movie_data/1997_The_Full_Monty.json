  "plot": "In the mid-1990s, the once-successful steel mills of Sheffield , South Yorkshire have shut down and most of the workers have been made redundant . Former steelworkers Gary \"Gaz\" Schofield and Dave Horsfall resort to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills and selling it to make money, taking Gaz's son Nathan with them for assistance, but a security guard keeps surprising them and locking them inside the mill. Gaz is facing trouble from his former wife Mandy and her boyfriend Barry over child support payments that he cannot pay since losing his job. Nathan lives with Mandy and Barry but Gaz has joint custody of him with Mandy. Mandy is seeking a court ruling giving her sole custody of Nathan. One day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a club to see a Chippendales' striptease act, and is inspired to form his own striptease group using local men, hoping to make enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at the mill where Dave and Gaz once worked, whose suicide attempt they interrupt. Next, they recruit Gerald Cooper, their former foreman, who is hiding his unemployment from his wife. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class, and recruit him to teach them some moves. Looking for more recruits, the four men hold an open audition and settle on Horse, an older man who is a good dancer, and Guy, who cannot dance but proves to be unusually well-endowed. The six men begin to practise their act. Gaz then learns that he has to pay a Â£100 deposit to secure the club for the night. He cannot afford this, but Nathan gets the money out of his savings, saying that he trusts Gaz to repay him. When they are greeted by two women while putting up posters for the show, Gaz boasts that they are better than the real Chippendales because they go \"the full monty \". Dave, struggling with his body image, drops out and finds a job as a security guard at Asda . The others publicly rehearse at the mill for some female relatives of Horse, but a passing policeman catches them mid-show, and Gaz, Gerald and Horse are arrested for indecent exposure, costing Gaz the right to see Nathan. Lomper and Guy escape to Lomper's house and start a relationship. Gerald is thrown out by Linda after bailiffs arrive at their house and seize their belongings to pay Gerald's debts, resulting in him having to stay with Gaz. Later Gaz goes to Asda and asks Dave if he could \"borrow\" a jacket for Lomper's mother's funeral. Dave agrees and also decides to quit his security job. They steal two suit jackets and go to the funeral. Soon, the group find that the act and their arrest has popularised them. They agree to forgo the plan, until Gaz learns that the show is sold out. He convinces the others to do it just for one night only. Initially Dave still refuses, but regains his confidence after encouragement from his wife, Jean, and joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. Nathan also arrives with Dave, having secretly come along, and tells Gaz that Mandy is there, but she would not let Barry go with her. Gaz refuses to do the act because there are men in the audience (including the police officers who watched the footage of the security camera's recording of them earlier), when the posters were supposed to say it was for women only. The other five are starting the act when Nathan orders Gaz to go out on stage. Gaz, proud of his son, joins the others and performs in front of the audience and Mandy, who seems to see him in a new light. Their act is a success.",
