  "plot": "In February 1969, Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, a former Western TV star , copes with a fading career, his most recent roles being guest appearances as TV villains. Agent Marvin Schwarz suggests working in spaghetti Westerns in Italy, which Dalton considers inferior. Dalton's best friend, stunt double , personal assistant, and driver is Cliff Booth, a World War II veteran living in a trailer with his pit bull Brandy. Booth struggles to find stunt work due to a past altercation with Bruce Lee , and rumors that he killed his wife. Although he does not know them personally, Dalton is aware that young actress Sharon Tate and her husband, director Roman Polanski , live next door . Dalton longs to befriend them, thinking it could reignite his career. While fixing the TV antenna on Dalton's roof, Booth notices a hippie arriving at the Polanski residence. The man, Charles Manson , asks for music producer Terry Melcher , but Tate's friend, Jay Sebring , says Melcher has moved. Later, Tate watches herself in The Wrecking Crew at a local film theater , and Booth gives hitchhiker Pussycat a ride to Spahn Ranch , a former Western film set where Booth did stunt work. Booth checks on George Spahn , the ranch's nearly blind owner, seeking to make sure the hippies living there are not exploiting him. Booth physically forces ranch hippie Clem to change his car tire after it was deliberately punctured. The hippies' leader Tex is summoned to deal with the situation, but he arrives as Booth is driving away. While filming an episode for the TV series Lancer , Dalton struggles to deliver his lines, causing him to have an emotional breakdown in his trailer. He later gives a powerful performance during his character's speech, impressing director Sam Wanamaker and his co-star Trudi, boosting his confidence. Schwarz books Dalton to star in a Sergio Corbucci spaghetti Western. Booth accompanies Dalton for the six-month shoot in Italy, where Dalton films three additional films and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. Before returning to the US, Dalton tells Booth that he can no longer afford his salary, which Booth amicably understands. Returning to Los Angeles on August 8, 1969, Dalton and Booth go drinking to commemorate their time together. Returning to Dalton's house, Booth smokes an acid -laced cigarette and takes Brandy for a walk, while Dalton makes margaritas . Manson's followers Tex, Sadie , Katie and Flowerchild arrive to murder the Tate house occupants . Hearing a car's loud muffler , an enraged Dalton orders the group off the private street. Recognizing him, the family members decide to kill him instead, when Sadie reasons that through shows such as Dalton’s, Hollywood has \"taught them to murder\". Flowerchild deserts the group, fleeing with their car. Breaking into Dalton's house armed with knives and a gun, the remaining group confronts Capucci and Booth, with Tex announcing that he is “the Devil and here to do the Devil’s business”. Booth recognizes them from Spahn Ranch and orders Brandy to attack. Brandy mauls Tex and bites off his genitals, and Cliff finishes him off by stomping him to death. He is stabbed by Katie, but swiftly beats her to death using random objects around the home. Brandy attacks and disfigures Sadie, who crashes through the back garden and startles Dalton, who has been listening to music and was totally unaware of the fighting inside. As Sadie attempts to shoot him, Dalton retrieves a working stunt flamethrower from a shed and incinerates her with it. After the police have taken statements and an ambulance brings Booth to hospital, Sebring and Tate invite Dalton to Tate’s house for a drink.",
