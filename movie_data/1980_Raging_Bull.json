  "plot": "In 1941, Jake LaMotta is a young up-and-coming middleweight boxer who suffers his first loss to Jimmy Reeves after a controversial decision. Jake's brother Joey discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts. Still, he repeatedly refuses the Mafia's help, wanting to win the championship on his terms. Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie at a swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, despite being already married, and Vickie is underage. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson , and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite Jake dominating Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson, who Joey feels won only because he was enlisting in the Army the following week. By 1945, Jake marries Vickie, but he is controlling and domineering over her, and constantly worries that she has feelings for other men. His jealousy is evident when he brutally beats his next opponent, Tony Janiro , in front of Tommy Como, the local mob boss , and Vickie. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana , he is distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vickie, who implies that she is dissatisfied in her marriage with Jake. Under the mistaken impression that Vickie is having an affair with Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como orders them to apologize to each other, but has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive . Jake purposely loses his next match against Billy Fox , and is booed out of the building after putting up a lackluster performance. He is suspended from the board shortly thereafter on suspicion of throwing the fight. He is reinstated and, in 1949, wins the middleweight championship title against Marcel Cerdan . In 1950, Jake becomes increasingly paranoid that Vickie is having an affair. He asks Joey if he has had an affair with her, which enrages Joey and causes him to leave. Jake presses Vickie about whether she has had an affair, leading to her sarcastically confessing that she had sex with Joey, Salvy, and Tommy. In a fit of rage, Jake, followed by Vickie, walks to Joey's house and assaults him in front of his wife, Lenora, and their children before knocking Vickie unconscious. Vickie returns to their home and threatens to leave, but they reconcile. After defending his championship belt in a grueling 15-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he calls his brother after the fight to make amends. Still, when Joey assumes that Salvy is on the other end and starts insulting him, Jake silently hangs up. Estranged from his brother, Jake sees his career decline, and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951 . By 1956, an aging and overweight Jake has retired and moved with his family to Miami . After he stays out all night at the nightclub that he owns, Vickie tells him that she wants a divorce, as well as full custody of their children. She also threatens to call the police if he comes anywhere near them. Jake is arrested for admitting underage girls to his nightclub, and he unsuccessfully attempts to bribe his way out of his criminal case using the jewels from his championship belt. In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. After returning to New York City in 1958, he encounters Joey, whom he forcefully embraces. Joey half-heartedly reciprocates. In 1964, Jake performs stand-up comedy at various clubs. Backstage before a show, LaMotta prepares for his performance by shadowboxing , quoting scenes from On the Waterfront and chanting \"I'm the boss\" before taking the stage.",
