  "plot": "In a nursing home , elderly Irish-American World War II veteran Frank Sheeran recounts his time as a hitman for the Italian-American Mafia . In 1950s Philadelphia , Sheeran works as a union delivery truck driver, where he starts selling some of the meat shipments to a local Philadelphia Italian-American gangster known as \"Skinny Razor,\" a member of the Philadelphia crime family headed by Angelo Bruno . After the delivery company accuses Sheeran of theft, union lawyer Bill Bufalino gets the case dismissed when Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin Russell Bufalino , head of his namesake crime family in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for him, as well as members of the South Philadelphia underworld, including \"painting houses,\" a euphemism for contract killing. Sheeran is soon introduced to Jimmy Hoffa , head of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. He is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano , in addition to mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy; in turn Sheeran becomes his chief bodyguard . After the 1960 election of John F. Kennedy , Bufalino is thrilled while Hoffa is furious. Kennedy's brother, Robert F. Kennedy , whom he appointed Attorney General , forms a \"Get Hoffa\" squad to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for jury tampering . While Hoffa is in prison, his replacement as Teamsters president, Frank \"Fitz\" Fitzsimmons , misuses the union's pension fund and gives interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion , also deteriorates beyond repair when Hoffa refuses to help restore his forfeited pension. Hoffa's sentence is commuted by President Richard Nixon in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980. Despite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. His growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and his intention to separate the union from the Mafia begin to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell pleads with Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he \"knows things\" that Russell and the dons of other families are unaware of and claims that what he knows makes him untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him, they would all end up in prison. In 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell reluctantly informs Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Russell further informs Sheeran that he must serve as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to a private airport where Sheeran boards a plane to Detroit . Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local restaurant with Tony Pro and Anthony Giacalone , is surprised to see Sheeran arriving late, with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and loan shark Sally Bugs . They tell Hoffa the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting, so Sheeran is to drive him over there. Entering the house, Hoffa realizes it is empty and that he has been set up. He turns around to leave, at which point Sheeran shoots him dead at point-blank range and leaves the gun on his body by the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two other mobsters wrap up the body and cremate it in secret. Invoking their Fifth Amendment rights in a grand jury investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro, and others are eventually convicted and incarcerated on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder; all but Sheeran die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters. Peggy, however, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance, has since severed all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a Catholic priest assigned to the nursing home, who assures him an overall absolution for whatever crimes committed or denied over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's safety habits.",
