  "plot": "Maya is a CIA analyst tasked with finding the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden . In 2003, she is stationed at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan . She and CIA officer Dan Fuller attend the black site interrogations of Ammar , a detainee with suspected links to several of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks and who is subjected to approved enhanced interrogation techniques . Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia , but reveals the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti . Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed. In 2009, Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica travels to a US base in Afghanistan to meet a Jordanian doctor, highly placed in al-Qaeda, who has offered to become a US spy for $25 million. Instead, he turns out to be a triple agent loyal to al-Qaeda, and Jessica is killed, along with several other CIA officers, when he detonates a suicide vest in what will come to be known as the Camp Chapman attack , the worst attack on CIA personnel in 25 years. Thomas, an analyst who linked the Abu Ahmed lead, shares with Maya an interrogation of a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier, information that was buried and lost track of in one of the many files of information that had been accumulated at the time—that is—that in 2001, a man named Ibrahim Sayeed traveled under the nom de guerre of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Seeing his picture, realizing that it is similar to but not the man in the picture they had that they thought was of Abu Ahmed, and that her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the CIA headquarters . She speculates that the CIA's photograph of Ahmed is in fact one of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining the account of Ahmed's supposed death in 2001. A Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeed's mother to Dan for a Lamborghini Gallardo Bicolore . Maya and her CIA team in Pakistan use electronic methods to eventually pinpoint a caller in a moving vehicle who exhibits behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity (which Maya calls tradecraft , thus confirming that the subject is likely a senior courier). They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C. as her cover is believed blown. The CIA puts the compound under surveillance but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The President's National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President Barack Obama , the CIA director holds a meeting of his senior officers, who estimate that bin Laden is 60–80% likely to be in the compound. Maya, also in the meeting, places her confidence at 100%. On May 2, 2011, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flies two stealth helicopters from Afghanistan into Pakistan with members of DEVGRU (SEAL Team Six) and the CIA's Special Activities Division to raid the compound. The SEALs gain entry and kill several people in the compound, including a man whom they believe is bin Laden. At a U.S. base in Jalalabad , Afghanistan, Maya confirms the identity of the corpse. Maya boards a military transport plane, back to the U.S., as its sole passenger, and when asked where she wants to go, she begins to cry.",
