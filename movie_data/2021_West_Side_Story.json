  "plot": "In 1957, the Jets, a gang of white youths, brawl with the Sharks, a gang of Puerto Rican youths, for control of San Juan Hill on Manhattan's Upper West Side . New York City Police Department Sergeant Krupke and Lieutenant Schrank disband their latest scuffle, with Schrank deriding their conflict as pointless since the neighborhood will soon be demolished to make way for Lincoln Center . The gangs are too proud to care, and Jet leader Riff proposes a rumble between the two gangs. He approaches his friend Tony, who is on parole, for help. Tony declines, wishing to reform himself with the help of Valentina, the Puerto Rican owner of Doc's general store. Meanwhile, María, Shark leader Bernardo's sister, is betrothed to his friend Chino, but yearns for an independent future. At a neighborhood dance in the community center that night, Tony and María meet and fall in love, infuriating Bernardo; however, Bernardo accepts Riff's terms to participate in the proposed rumble, provided that Tony attends as well. Tony later confesses his love to María on her fire escape , and they vow to reconvene the next day. Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita argue about life in New York compared to Puerto Rico, with Anita's belief in the American Dream contrasting with Bernardo's rude pessimism. Police interrogate the Jets, who deny any knowledge about the rumble. During their date at the Cloisters, Tony reveals to María that his year-long imprisonment for nearly beating a rival gang member to death had scared him into reforming. María makes Tony promise to stop the rumble, and they make promises to one another as if marrying before God. Later, Tony tries to convince Riff to call off the rumble by stealing his newly bought gun, but the Jets steal it back, with Riff reasserting that the rumble will happen as scheduled. Schrank orders Krupke and other police officers to stop the rumble from occurring, but they are unsuccessful. Arriving at the rumble, Tony speaks to Riff, who is so confident Tony has joined them, he relinquishes the gun. Tony then explains his feelings for Maria to Bernardo. But Bernardo uses his boxing skills to injure Tony as Tony refuses to fight. Bernardo then goes after Riff so Tony fights, punching Bernardo on the ground but stopping before knocking him unconscious. Unwilling to let Tony walk away, Bernardo goes after him and produces a knife. After a brief duel, Bernardo fatally stabs Riff before Tony fatally stabs Bernardo. The gangs flee when the police arrive, and Chino walks away last with Riff's gun. María gushes about her love for Tony to her coworkers in the late-night cleaning crew at the Gimbels department store. Once their shift is over, she spots Chino, who reveals that Tony killed Bernardo. She cannot believe it until Tony comes to her room later and admits it. She is furious with him but begs him not to turn himself in to the police as it would mean losing him as well. They plan to run away together. Valentina laments Bernardo's and Riff's deaths while reflecting on her interracial relationship with her deceased white husband Doc. After identifying Bernardo's body at the morgue, Anita returns home and sees María and Tony together as he leaves the apartment. Anita argues with María, but eventually accepts that she and Tony are in love. At the boxing gym Chino plans to kill Tony with the gun, but the Sharks tell him 'you kill a gringo they kill you.' Schrank interrogates María at her apartment about Tony's whereabouts. María sends Anita to ask Valentina about the safety of \"a cousin\" as a way of passing on a warning for Tony in front of Schrank. However, at Doc's, Anita encounters the Jets, who insult and attempt to gang rape her, even as their girls protest, until Valentina arrives and intervenes. Traumatized, Anita calls Valentina a traitor for housing the Jets, then claims that Chino killed María, and vows to return to Puerto Rico. Valentina condemns the Jets, who shamefully disperse, before relaying Anita's message to Tony, who runs into the streets, begging for Chino to kill him. Anybodys tries to get him off the street but fails. As María arrives, to Tony's relief, Chino emerges and fatally shoots him. After Tony dies in her arms, a devastated María takes the gun and aims it at the gathered Jets and Sharks, berating them for the senseless deaths their conflict caused, before tearfully dropping the gun. As the police arrive to arrest Chino, the gangs finally end the feud by coming together to carry Tony's corpse into Doc's, with María following close behind.",
