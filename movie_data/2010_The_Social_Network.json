  "plot": "In intercut frame stories , two ongoing depositions play out: in one, Mark Zuckerberg is being sued by his former friend Eduardo Saverin , and in the other he is sued by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss . On October 28, 2003, Zuckerberg, a Harvard University sophomore, is dumped by his girlfriend, Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting post about her on his LiveJournal blog. Zuckerberg creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking and downloading photos of female students from house face books , then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation . Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of the Winklevoss twins and their business partner Divya Narendra . The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection , a social network exclusive to Harvard students and aimed at dating. Soon after, Zuckerberg approaches Saverin with an idea for \" TheFacebook \", a social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Zuckerberg to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of TheFacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while misleading them by stalling development on the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers , who is dismissive and sees no value in disciplinary action on TheFacebook or Zuckerberg. Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to \"Facebook me,\" which impresses them. As TheFacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg expands the network to Yale , Columbia , and Stanford . Saverin begins dating Lee, who arranges for him and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker . Parker presents a \"billion-dollar\" vision for the company, impressing Zuckerberg. Saverin dismisses Parker as paranoid and delusional outside of his suggestion to rename TheFacebook to Facebook . Zuckerberg relocates the company to Palo Alto based on Parker's advice; Saverin remains in New York to work on business development, while breaking up with Lee. Parker later moves into the house that Zuckerberg is using as a base of operations and becomes more involved with the company, much to Saverin's annoyance. After narrowly losing in the 2004 Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub , the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Europe with Oxford , Cambridge and LSE , and decide to sue the company for intellectual property theft . Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel . Saverin is invited to the company's new headquarters on the pretense of attending a business meeting and \"millionth user party,\" but is enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal dilutes his share of Facebook from 34% to 0.03%, without diluting the ownership percentage of any other owner. Furthermore, he has already been removed from the masthead as co-founder and CFO. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, vowing to sue as security removes him from the building. Shortly after, Parker is apprehended for cocaine possession with a minor at a party celebrating one million users. He attempts to blame Saverin, prompting Zuckerberg to cut ties with him. Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for Zuckerberg, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's callous attitude will make him unsympathetic to a jury. Alone, Zuckerberg sends a Facebook friend request to Albright and repeatedly refreshes the page. Closing text reveals both cases were settled out of court and Zuckerberg became the world's youngest billionaire.",
