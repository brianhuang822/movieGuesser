  "plot": "In 1941, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a bugler and career soldier who was once a professional boxer, transfers from Fort Shafter to a rifle company at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu . Captain Dana \"Dynamite\" Holmes wants him on his regimental boxing team, but Prewitt refuses absolutely, with no further explanation. Consequently, Holmes makes Prewitt's life miserable and ultimately orders First Sergeant Milton Warden to prepare a court-martial . Warden suggests doubling Prewitt's company punishment as an alternative. Prewitt is hazed by the other NCOs and is supported only by his close friend, Private Angelo Maggio. Prewitt and Maggio join a social club where Prewitt becomes attracted to Lorene. Prewitt confides to her he quit boxing after blinding his sparring partner. At the club, Maggio argues with stockade Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson. Later, at a local bar, Judson provokes Maggio and the two nearly come to blows before Warden intervenes. Despite being warned, Warden risks prison when he starts fraternizing with Holmes's wife, Karen. Her marriage to Holmes is unhappy and distant, made worse after Holmes's drinking and infidelity resulted in the stillbirth of her only child and consequent infertility. Karen encourages Warden to become an officer, which would enable her to divorce Holmes and marry him. Maggio is sentenced to the stockade after walking off guard duty and getting drunk, subjecting him to Judson's unqualified (and unauthorized) wrath. Prewitt discovers Lorene's name is really Alma, and her goal is to make enough money at the club to go back to the mainland and marry. Prewitt tells her his career is in the military, and the two wonder whether they have a future together. A member of Holmes's boxing team, Sergeant Galovitch, picks a fight with Prewitt. Holmes fails to stop it, which is noticed by the regimental commander. When Prewitt prevails in the fight, Holmes finally intervenes and is about to punish Prewitt again; but, does nothing after learning Galovitch started the fight. Maggio escapes from the stockade after a brutal beating from Judson and dies in Prewitt's arms. Seeking revenge, Prewitt engages Judson in a back alley knife fight. Prewitt kills Judson but is badly wounded and stays with Lorene. Warden covers for Prewitt's absence . After initiating a review into Holmes's conduct, the regimental commander orders his resignation in lieu of a court martial. Holmes's replacement, Captain Ross, reprimands the other NCOs, demotes Galovitch to private, and affirms there will be no more promotions through boxing. Karen tells Warden that Holmes's resignation is forcing them back to the mainland, but Warden reveals he has no interest in becoming an officer, effectively ending their relationship. Warden promises her that they will meet somewhere someday. On December 7, the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor . Warden takes command, orders coffee be made and leads a fierce resistance to the attack. Despite Lorene's pleas to stay with her, Prewitt attempts to rejoin his company but is shot dead by military police when he refuses to halt. Warden identifies him as a hardhead but a good soldier. Days later, Karen and Lorene coincidentally stand next to each other on a ship going to the mainland. Karen tosses her leis into the sea, wondering if she will ever return to Hawaii. Lorene tells Karen she herself will not return, as her \"fianc√©\", whom she identifies as Prewitt, was a bomber pilot who died during the attack and was awarded a Silver Star . Karen recognizes the name but says nothing.",
