  "plot": "Gunner's Mate Second Class Joe Brady and Seaman First Class Clarence Doolittle are United States Navy sailors who have a four-day leave in San Diego, which they decide to spend in Hollywood. Joe has his heart set on making up for eight months at sea with his girl, Lola. Clarence, a shy choir boy turned sailor, asks Joe to teach him how to meet girls. Donald, a little boy who wants to join the navy, is found wandering around the boulevard by a policeman, who takes him to the station. Donald refuses to tell the police his name and where he lives, so sailors Clarence and Joe are brought in to help convince the little boy to go home. After the two sailors take Donald to his house, Joe is eager to spend the evening with Lola, but Donald insists they stay until his Aunt Susie arrives. Clarence is smitten with the beautiful, demeure young woman. Susan goes on to tell them that she has been working as an extra in movies and trying to become a singer. She longs to perform with the famous pianist and conductor Jos√© Iturbi. Trying to impress Susan with Clarence, Joe lies that Clarence is a personal friend of Iturbi, and can arrange an audition for her. Later, the three go out to the restaurant where Susan works. Clarence meets a waitress from Brooklyn and they are attracted to each other. The next day, Joe visits Donald's school and tells the kids the story of how he earned his medal, by bringing happiness to a lonesome young king (portrayed by the animated Jerry Mouse of Tom and Jerry ) and joy to his kingdom where music had been forbidden. Meanwhile, Clarence and Joe attempt to meet Iturbi at the MGM studios, the Hollywood Bowl and his home, but all fall flat. When all hope seems lost, the pair decide to come clean with Susan and tell her there is no audition, but she is so grateful and happy, they are unable to do so. On their last day of leave, Susan runs into Iturbi in the studio commissary, who knows nothing of her and the audition. Susan realizes the situation and is devastated; she tells him the whole story. Taken with her charm, beauty, and sincerity, Iturbi agrees to give her a screen test, which turns out to be a success. The movie ends with Iturbi conducting the Navy band while its choir sings \"Anchors Aweigh\" and Joe and Susan, and Clarence and the \"Girl from Brooklyn,\" kiss.",
