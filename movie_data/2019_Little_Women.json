Jo is hurt and angry when Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor who lives at her boarding house , gives critical feedback on her writing. Upon learning that her younger sister Beth's illness has worsened, Jo returns home to Concord, Massachusetts . Seven years earlier in 1861, Jo meets her neighbor Laurie while attending a party with her older sister Meg. On Christmas morning, the girls' mother \"Marmee\" persuades them to give their breakfast to their poor neighbors, Mrs. Hummel and her children. After returning home, the Marches find their table laden with food, given by their neighbor and Laurie's grandfather, Mr. Laurence. Marmee then reads a letter from their father, who is fighting in the American Civil War . Jo regularly reads to her father's sister Aunt March, hoping she will invite her to Europe . When Jo, Meg, Laurie, and Laurie's tutor John Brooke attend the theater , a jealous Amy burns Jo's unpublished novel. The next morning Amy, wanting an angry Jo's forgiveness, chases her and Laurie onto a frozen lake. Amy falls through the ice but Laurie and Jo save her. Mr. Laurence invites Beth to play his late daughter's piano in his house. In the present, Meg expresses unhappiness about being poor to John after having bought fabric they cannot afford. Laurie visits Amy to apologize for his behavior, urging her not to marry Fred, but instead marry him. Though in love with Laurie, Amy refuses, upset at always being second to Jo. Despite this, she turns down Fred's proposal. In the past, Mr. Laurence gifts Beth the piano and discovers she has contracted scarlet fever from the Hummels. To avoid exposure to the illness, Amy is sent to stay with Aunt March, who advises her to provide for her family by marrying well. John urges Meg to turn the fabric into a dress in the present to make her happy, but she reveals she sold it, reassuring him she is happy to be his wife. Beth recovers in time for Christmas in the past, and their father returns home as well. After worsening in the present, Beth dies.

After the wedding, Laurie proposes to Jo, who refuses, explaining she does not see herself marrying. In the present, Marmee reveals that Amy is returning from Europe with an ill Aunt March. Jo wonders whether she was too quick to refuse Laurie so writes him a letter. Preparing to leave, Amy tells Laurie she turned down Fred's proposal; they kiss and later marry on the journey home. Jo and Laurie agree to remain friends, after which she discards the letter she wrote him. Jo begins writing a novel based on her and her sisters' lives and sends the first chapters to an unimpressed Mr. Dashwood. Bhaer surprises Jo by turning up at the March house on his way to California . In New York, Mr. Dashwood agrees to publish Jo's novel as his daughters demand to know how it ends, but he refuses to accept the protagonist remaining unmarried at the end. To appease him, Jo ends her novel with the protagonist, herself, stopping Bhaer from leaving for California. She successfully negotiates copyright and royalties with Mr. Dashwood. Following Aunt March's death, Jo inherits her house and opens it as a school, where Meg, Amy, John, and Bhaer all teach. Jo observes the printing of her novel, titled Little Women .",
