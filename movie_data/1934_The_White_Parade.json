  "plot": "In 1907, June Arden enrolls at the Mitchell-Reed School for Nurses with the ambition of following in the footsteps of Florence Nightingale. She shares a room with Zita Scofield, who struggles with homesickness. June mentions her acquaintance with Ronald Hall III, a wealthy polo player, a relationship later confirmed by Ronald's secretary. After six months of study, the students pass their first examination and begin practical training at a nearby hospital. Despite the demanding workload, Gertrude Mack, one of the students, frequently interferes in others' affairs. When Gertrude learns that Ronald will visit the city, she inquires if June plans to meet him. June meets Ronald at the train station, and they soon develop a genuine romantic relationship. During the course, June faces difficulties balancing her studies with her relationship. After a disagreement over June's nursing career, Ronald is involved in a car accident and recuperates at the hospital where June works. June requests a shift change to care for him but ultimately chooses to attend to a terminally ill patient instead. Two weeks before the final exams, Zita is reprimanded for slow performance and, following a conflict with her boyfriend Dr. Jim Moore, attempts suicide with anesthetics. June, responsible for the anesthesia keys, had temporarily entrusted them to another staff member. Zita is saved by surgeon Dr. Thorne, who, alongside head nurse Sailor Roberts, advocates for June to remain enrolled despite the incident. The school principal permits June to continue and take the final examination. On graduation day, Gertrude apologizes to June for previous behavior. June's relationship with Ronald ends after he insists she abandon her nursing career upon marriage. June affirms her dedication to nursing, a decision supported by Dr. Thorne.",
