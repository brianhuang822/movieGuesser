  "plot": "In the late 1890s, a young Cappadocian Greek , Stavros Topouzoglou, lives in an impoverished village below Mount Erciyes in Ottoman Turkey . The subjugated life of the Cappadocian Greeks and Armenians of Kayseri is depicted, including the Derinkuyu Underground City traditional cliff cave dwellings, where Stavros' grandmother lives. Stavros and his Armenian friend Vartan plan to go to the faraway land of opportunity – America – together. Stavros witnesses a Hamidian massacre against the Armenians, which leaves Vartan dead, [ 1 ] and Stavros is nearly imprisoned trying to recover Vartan's mutilated corpse. Knowing that the Greeks won't remain safe from the violent pogroms forever, the family plans to send Stavros to Constantinople , the Ottoman capital, to eventually settle the family there. He is entrusted by his father, Issac, with the family's entire fortune in money, jewels, rugs, whatever is greatest in value and transportable, including the family donkey. Once successful, he is to send first for his sisters, then his brothers, and establish them safely and prosperously there as well.  To do this he will invest in the carpet business of his father's cousin Odysseus by buying his way in with his family's meager accumulated wealth. Though this is his father's dream, it is not Stavros' as he is still determined to go to America. Stavros' odyssey begins with a long voyage on donkey and on foot through the impoverished towns and villages of the Anatolian countryside. Along the way, the naïve young dreamer is robbed of everything, kills the thief in retribution, and arrives at his cousin's home penniless. The older man, who had deceived Stavros' father, is deeply disappointed, as he was counting on Issac's wealth to rescue his failing carpet business. In an attempt to exploit a valuable opportunity Stavros still represents to him, Odysseus proposes that his handsome young cousin marry the plain and needy Thomna, daughter of a wealthy Greek carpet merchant, Aleko Sinnikoglou. Stavros realizes this would mean the end of his dream and adamantly refuses, abruptly leaving the angry cousin. Now homeless on the streets, Stavros survives by eating discarded food and working at backbreaking and hazardous jobs. He is befriended by a streetwise older man, Garabet, who helps him toward his dream.  After nine months of scrimping and self-denial, Stavros has saved nine Turkish pounds towards the 110 pound third class passage to New York, but he has every penny thieved by a prostitute in his first sexual encounter. Clinging to Garabet, he ends up at a gathering of local anarchists planning a terrorist bombing. However, before they can disburse, they are slaughtered by police gunfire.  Left for dead, Stavros ends up in a hospital, only to be thrown atop a wagon filled with dead bodies headed for disposal in the sea. He accidentally slides off and all but crawls back to his cousin's. Odysseus takes pity on the young man and allows him to recover at his home. Broken for the moment, Stavros agrees to marry his intended bride. Before the ceremony she questions his sullen silence, and he admits that he still plans to emigrate to America by using her dowry money to buy a ticket as soon as he can slip away after they are wed. At this point Stavros becomes reacquainted with Hohannes, a young Armenian whom he had aided with food and clothing before his original voyage to Constantinople. Hohannes informs him that he is being sponsored to America by an employer seeking indentured labor , two years' worth in return for passage. By good fortune, Stavros begins an affair with Sophia, the sexually neglected, middle-aged wife of wealthy Armenian-American rug merchant Artoon Kebabian, a client of his prospective father-in-law.  Using money from Sophia, Stavros buys a ticket to New York and leaves Thomna heartbroken, without a word.  He ends up on the same ship as the Kebabians, he in steerage, they in first class. On the other side of the Atlantic the ship lies just offshore of New York City waiting to clear quarantine. Sophia sends her servant to fetch Stavros, and the two have a tryst while Artoon sleeps.  He awakes, discovers the affair, and taunts Stavros, who responds by physically attacking Kebabian.  Stavros is arrested and sentenced by the ship's captain to be returned to Turkey. Hohannes, who is scarcely able to pass inspection by the visiting immigration doctor by hiding his advanced tuberculosis , realizes Stavros will die if he is sent back, and he will die anyway.  Returning his friend's generosity, he jumps off the ship to his death.  Now short a man, the prospective American employer simply allows Stavros to assume Hohannes' identity and slip past immigration officials on Ellis Island , gifted a straw boater by Sophia and a new 'American' name by the chief inspector, \"Joe Arness\". In return, even though he had paid his own passage, “Joe” will have to work off Hohannes' debt by shining shoes, earning only his tips. A closing voiceover reveals that Joe was able to succeed in New York, and one by one brought every family member over – but his father, who, last in the line, died before his chance came.",
