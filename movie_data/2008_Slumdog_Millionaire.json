  "plot": "In 1992, five-year-old Jamal Malik, a resident of the Juhu slum of Mumbai , obtains the autograph of Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan after jumping into a cesspit ; the crowds around Amitabh Bachchan are deterred by Jamal as he is covered head to toe in human feces. Jamal's elder brother Salim later sells the autograph. Their mother is killed during the Bombay riots . While fleeing the riot, the brothers encounter a child dressed up as Rama , with a bow and arrow in their right hand. Having escaped the riots and taken shelter from the rain, the brothers meet Latika, a girl from their slum. Jamal suggests that she could be their \"third musketeer\", a reference to The Three Musketeers , a novel which the brothers learned about in school. The brothers refer to themselves as Athos and Porthos but cannot remember the third musketeer's name. The three children are found by Maman—a gangster who trains street children to become beggars. After witnessing Maman blinding the children to make them more effective beggars with hot oil, Salim escapes with Jamal and Latika. The brothers board a moving train, but Latika cannot keep up. Salim grabs her hand but purposefully lets go after Lathika had placed hot chili peppers in his undergarments while Salim was sleeping the night before, leaving her to be recaptured by Maman. For the next years, Salim and Jamal travel on top of trains, making a living by selling goods, pickpocketing , washing dishes, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal . At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika and discover that Maman is raising her to be a prostitute . The brothers rescue her, Salim shooting Maman dead. Salim gets a job with Javed—a rival crime lord. In their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him alone with Latika, presumably to sexually assault her. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, and Latika persuades Jamal to leave. In 2004, Jamal, now working as a chaiwala in a call centre , learns that Salim is a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal confronts Salim, who pleads for forgiveness. Jamal then sneaks into Javed's residence and reunites with Latika. Although he professes his love for her, she tells him to forget her. Despite the refusal, Jamal promises to wait for her every day at five o'clock at Victoria Terminus . Attempting to meet him there, Latika is captured by Javed's men, led by Salim. He scars her face while driving away. Jamal loses contact with Latika and in a final attempt to reach her, he becomes a contestant on Kaun Banega Crorepati , knowing that she watches the show. Jamal plays well and becomes popular across India, much to the dismay of the show's host, Prem Kumar. Kumar attempts to trick Jamal by feeding him the wrong answer to the penultimate question; however, Jamal answers correctly. When the episode ends, Jamal is arrested and tortured by the police , who suspect him of cheating. The police inspector eventually listens to his explanation of how he knew each answer. The officer believes Jamal and allows him to return to the show. Latika sees that Jamal was arrested on the news. Feeling guilty about his past behaviour, Salim gives Latika his phone and car keys, asking her to forgive him. After Latika leaves, Salim fills a bathtub with money and sits in it, waiting for Javed to realise what happened. For the final ₹ 2 crore question, Jamal is asked the name of the third musketeer. Jamal admits to not knowing the answer and uses his \"Phone-A-Friend\" lifeline to call Salim because it is the only phone number he knows. Latika answers and tells Jamal that she is safe, but does not know the answer. Javed hears Latika on the show and realises that Salim betrayed him. He and his men break down the bathroom door. Salim kills Javed before getting killed by the gang. Relieved about Latika, Jamal guesses and picks the first answer, Aramis . He is correct and wins the grand prize. Jamal and Latika meet on the platform at the train station and kiss.",
