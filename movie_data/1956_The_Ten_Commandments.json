  "plot": "After hearing the prophecy of a Hebrew deliverer that would free the Hebrews from Egyptian bondage, Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt ordered the death of all newborn Hebrew males. Yochabel saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile . Rameses I's recently widowed daughter Bithiah finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy by naming him Moses , even though her servant Memnet recognizes the child's Hebrew heritage. Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general , winning a war with Ethiopia and establishing an alliance. Moses falls in love with the princess Nefretiri .  But, she is betrothed to whomever Sethi chooses to become the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua , who tells him of the Hebrew God. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed, not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the master builder, Baka. Moses reforms the treatment of slaves on the project, but Prince Rameses , Moses's adoptive brother and Sethi's son, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is merely making the slaves more productive, and after demonstrating the results, Sethi declares him the next Pharaoh. Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet, but reveals the story to Moses after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house, where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam. Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace, so that he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he, too, is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the Hebrew overseer Dathan , who then reports to Prince Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi reluctantly declares Prince Rameses his sole heir, and Rameses banishes Moses to the desert. At this time, Moses learns of the death of his mother. Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in Midian . After defending seven sisters from Amalekites , Moses is housed with the girls' father Jethro , a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter Sephora . Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped from the hard labor imposed on the Hebrews in Egypt. While herding, Moses sees the burning bush on the summit of Mount Sinai and hears the voice of God. At God's command, Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews. Moses comes before Rameses, now Pharaoh Rameses II , to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a cobra . Jannes performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married. To convince Rameses of obliging to his wishes, Moses gets God to initiate plagues against Egypt . Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of Khnum , and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him that the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders that all first-born sons of Hebrews will die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the first-born sons of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Despairing at the loss of his heir, Rameses gives in to Moses' demands and frees the Hebrews, who begin the Exodus from Egypt. Bithiah reunites with Moses and goes with the Hebrews. After being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his chariots and pursues the Hebrews to the Red Sea . Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire , and parts the Red Sea . After the Hebrews make it across to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God. Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the Ten Commandments created by God in two stone tablets . Meanwhile, Dathan exploits the people to gain power, claiming that Moses is dead and urging a reluctant Aaron to construct a golden calf idol. A wild Saturnalia occurs and a decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews. After God informs them of the Hebrews' sins, Moses and Joshua descend from the mountain. Enraged at his own people's betrayal of God, Moses deems the Hebrews unworthy and smashes the tablets at the golden calf, destroying it and sending Dathan and his cohorts to Hell . The remaining Hebrews are forced to wander in the wilderness for 40 years as punishment for their sins. An elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards Canaan , though he cannot enter himself because he disobeyed God at the Water of Strife. Moses names Joshua as the new leader of the Hebrews, bidding farewell to them at Mount Nebo .",
