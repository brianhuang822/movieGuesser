  "plot": "On June 7, 1893 in the Colony of Natal , young lawyer Mohandas Gandhi is forcibly expelled from a whites-only train carriage in Pietermaritzburg despite possessing a valid first class ticket, subsequently campaigning for Indian equality in the Colony of Natal and the Cape Colony . Dada Abdullah, president of the Natal Indian Congress , [ 7 ] notices his campaign and invites him to a demonstration where he burns his pass. After the Second Boer War , the British colonial government then attempts to enact a law where Indians will be fingerprinted, akin to criminals. Gandhi responds with numerous peaceful demonstrations against the new law's unjust nature, and the British colonial officer and former Boer general, Jan Smuts eventually orders his arrest. Later, the British colonial government releases Gandhi and relents by granting some rights to Indians, fulfilling his short-term goal. Anglican clergyman Charles Freer Andrews joins his mission, and Vince Walker, an American journalist from the New York Times , takes special interest in him. Gandhi's work is at his ashram, where many figures associated with him include Andrews, Hermann Kallenbuch , and later Madeleine Slade , whom Gandhi names Mirabehn. Gandhi returns to India in 1915 where he is cordially invited to the Indian National Congress where at an outdoor luncheon he gets to meet its leaders: Sardar Patel , a young Jawaharlal Nehru , Maulana Azad , and Muhammad Ali Jinnah , who is advocating self rule for India, as well as Gopal Krishna Gokhale , who becomes his mentor. Jinnah supports Gandhi's involvement in politics, but opposes his unconventional approach. At a meeting of the Congress led by Jinnah, Gandhi's speech captivates the ensemble, especially Patel. Gandhi pledges allegiance to the British Empire in World War I, but simultaneously demands self rule for India. His satyagrahas at Champaran and Kheda are brutally curtailed by the British. Despite Indian involvement in World War I, the administration in India passes the Rowlatt Act in 1919, which is seen by the movement as betrayal. While a group of people listen to speeches about freedom, General Reginald Dyer orders his Gurkha soldiers to fire upon them unawares, committing the Amritsar massacre . Jinnah suggests non-cooperation for protesting against British rule, and Gandhi surprisingly agrees. Its immediate success causes the Chauri Chaura incident , where protestors kill and burn police officers in the United Provinces . Disgusted, Gandhi orders to call off the non-cooperation movement, enraging Jinnah, before he retreats to his ashram and fasts to call off the masses. In 1930, after organizing the Salt March against the British monopoly on salt in India, accompanied by Vince Walker and his associate, Gandhi is arrested and sent to prison. When he is released, Gandhi is then invited to London by Ramsay MacDonald to attend the Round Table conferences regarding future Dominion status for the Indian Empire. However, they prove fruitless and Gandhi and the other Congress leaders are imprisoned during World War II. While under house arrest, Gandhi's wife Kasturba dies, and he mourns her. Dissatisfied by the Congress and Gandhi, Jinnah resigns and returns to the Muslim League , where he begins demands for a separate state to be made out of British India for the Muslim minority .  Gandhi is upset, and in 1945, Viceroy Louis Mountbatten declares India's upcoming independence as the territory's final Governor-General. Gandhi offers Jinnah to be Prime Minister and to choose its first cabinet; Nehru agrees to it to maintain India's independence, but Jinnah declines, stating that only independence for Pakistan with him as its leader, will ensure Muslim safety, upsetting Patel, Nehru, and Azad. India and Pakistan finally gain their independence back-to-back in August 1947, and millions of people cross the borders into the two newly-formed countries, but sectarian violence occurs along the new borders between Hindus and Muslims alike. The Indian military attempts to control uprisings in Delhi and Bombay, while in Calcutta murder and violence between Hindus and Muslims rampage through the streets. Devastated, Gandhi holds a fast unto death, causing Hindus to stand down and Huseyn Suhrawardy to call upon Muslims to stop fighting. Gandhi advises a concerned Hindu man, upset about murdering a Muslim infant to avenge his son's death in the violence, to find a Muslim boy whose family had died in the violence and raise him as a faithful Muslim. While heading to afternoon prayers in New Delhi on January 30, 1948, Gandhi is shot point blank 3 times by Nathuram Godse and exclaims \"Oh, God!\" as he perishes. After his funeral, his casket is carted throughout Delhi accompanied by a mourning Nehru (now the Prime Minister of India), numerous Indian citizens, government officials from all over India, and international dignitaries. His ashes are poured into the Ganges , and he is mourned by the leaders of the Congress and the Indian independence movement as a whole.",
