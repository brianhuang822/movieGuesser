  "plot": "In 1987, a nearly 70-year-old Leonard Bernstein plays a sequence on a piano from his opera A Quiet Place while being interviewed in his home. [ 7 ] After he finishes, he shares brief details regarding the significant impact left on him by Felicia , his wife of many years, and mentions seeing her ghost. In 1943, Leonard—then the 25-year-old assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic —makes his conducting debut at short notice when guest conductor Bruno Walter falls ill. His exceptional performance receives a rapturous reception from the audience and catapults him to fame. Despite being in an intermittent relationship with clarinetist David Oppenheim , he falls for aspiring actress Felicia Montealegre at a party and the two begin dating. He breaks up with David, who is heartbroken but reluctantly accepts Leonard's choice. Leonard and Felicia ultimately marry and have three children: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. Throughout their marriage, they are seen supporting each other in their careers. By the mid-1950s, the Bernsteins live a highly affluent life in the public eye, with Leonard having composed several successful operas and Broadway musicals, including Candide and West Side Story . Felicia combats concerns raised about Leonard's affairs with men, insistent that she holds rein over him as his wife. As the years pass, however, Leonard's dalliances—as well as his alcohol and substance abuse—take a deep toll on their marriage. These issues are compounded when Jamie hears whispers of her father's infidelity. Leonard attempts to deny the rumors as fueled by \"jealousies\". One Thanksgiving , after Leonard returns home to their apartment in The Dakota late from a bender, he and Felicia have an explosive argument where she insists that he has hate in his heart, and will \"die a lonely old queen\" if he continues on his current path. [ 8 ] Despite the breakdown of their relationship, the couple remains married through Leonard's composition of Mass in 1971. In 1973, Leonard conducts Mahler 's Resurrection Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra in a legendary performance at Ely Cathedral , England. Amidst the uproarious reception, Felicia reconciles with Leonard, insistent that \"there's no hate in [his] heart\". Felicia is diagnosed with breast cancer which has metastasized to the lung; despite surgeries and an aggressive chemotherapy regimen, her condition deteriorates, and she dies in Leonard's arms in 1978. Overcome with grief, Leonard and the children abandon their lavish home shortly afterward. Leonard is shown once again in 1987, teaching the art of conducting and still partying, as well as having affairs with his much younger male students. Returning to the interview, Leonard admits that he misses Felicia terribly, before his mind flashes back to an image of her, back in their youth, walking into their yard.",
