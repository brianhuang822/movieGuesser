  "plot": "During World War II , in its first combat encounter with the German Afrika Korps at the Battle of Kasserine Pass , the II Corps is defeated by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel . General George S. Patton assumes command of II Corps and institutes a harsh regime of discipline, while complaining the senior British field commander, General Bernard Montgomery , is monopolising the allied effort to suit his own needs. Patton's command redeems itself at the Battle of El Guettar . Following Allied victory in North Africa , Patton and Montgomery offer competing plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily . Patton suggests British landings at Syracuse due to its historical importance, with US forces landing at Palermo and capturing Messina to prevent Axis withdrawal. General Harold Alexander opts for Montgomery's more cautious plan of landing Patton's 7th US Army at the Gulf of Gela and Montgomery on eastern Sicily. The British and Canadians bog down, and Patton's army, expected only to provide flank support, instead drives northwest to take Palermo. Intent on capturing Messina before the British, he pushes subordinates Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott to make risky amphibious landings heedless of the cost. During a visit to a field hospital, Patton accused a crying soldier of cowardice and slaps him . He enters Messina as a conquering hero, but receives notice that he must apologize publicly for the slapping incident. Despite apologizing, he is sidelined for the coming Allied invasion of France and instead placed in command of the fictitious First United States Army Group as a decoy in London , the Allied command confident in that keeping Patton in England will tell the Germans that he will lead the invasion of Europe. To a public gathering in the town of Knutsford , Patton remarks that the post-war world will be dominated by the British-American spheres of influence; this comment is viewed as a slight to the Soviet Union . Despite Patton's protest that he has done nothing wrong, the situation has spiraled from his control, and the decision to send him home or remain in England is placed on General George Marshall . Though not present for the Normandy invasion, Patton is given command of the Third Army reporting to General Bradley, his former subordinate. Under his leadership, the Third Army sweeps across France , but it is brought to a halt just before entering Germany, because gasoline and other vital supplies have been instead allocated to Montgomery's Operation Market Garden . Frustrated at being sidelined to appease Montgomery, Patton demands to know why he was given a command if he cannot advance. Bradley retorts that it was actually Eisenhower's decision to place Patton in Europe, not his. During the Battle of the Bulge , Patton devises a plan to relieve the trapped 101st Airborne Division in Bastogne , which he does before smashing through the Siegfried Line and into Germany . After Germany capitulates , Patton's outspokenness lands him in trouble when he compares American politics to Nazism . Though he is relieved of command, he is kept on to see the rebuilding of Germany . He later walks Willie, his bull terrier , narrowly escaping death from a runaway cart (foreshadowing his death in a road accident some months later). Patton's voice is heard:",
