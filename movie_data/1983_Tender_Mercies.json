  "plot": "Washed-up, alcoholic country singer Mac Sledge awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee, and offers to perform maintenance work there in exchange for a room. Rosa, whose husband died in the Vietnam War , is raising her young son, Sonny, on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay on condition that he does not drink while working. During quiet evenings, they sit alone and share parts of their life stories. Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After enough days of keeping his word and doing his work, he is comfortable enough in his new life that he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. A newspaper reporter eventually visits the motel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and if he has deliberately chosen to lead an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about him and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott, a country music star who is performing nearby. After the story is published, the neighbourhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Despite greeting them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend, Harry. Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixue, who becomes angry on seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne. Upon returning home, Mac assures Rosa Lee he no longer has any feelings for Dixie. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no good. Hurt and angry, Mac drives away and nearly crashes the truck. He buys a bottle of whiskey but, returning home to a worried Rosa Lee and Sonny, he tells them he poured it out. He says he tried to leave Rosa Lee, but found he could not. Mac and Sonny are later baptised together in Rosa Lee's church. Eventually, Sue Anne visits Mac—their first encounter since she was a baby. Mac asks whether she got any of his letters, and she says her mother kept them from her. She also reports that Dixie tried to keep her from visiting Mac, and that, despite her mother's objections, she is eloping with her boyfriend. Mac admits that he used to hit Dixie and that she divorced him after he tried to kill her in a drunken rage. Sue Anne asks whether Mac remembers a song about a dove he sang to her when she was a baby. He claims he does not, but after she leaves, he sings to himself the hymn \" On the Wings of a Dove \". Boys at school bully Sonny about his dead father. Meanwhile, the members of the local country band ask Mac permission to perform one of his songs, and he agrees. Mac begins performing with them and they make plans to record together. His newfound happiness is interrupted when Sue Anne dies in a car accident. Mac attends his daughter's funeral at Dixie's lavish home in Nashville and comforts her when she breaks down. Back home, Mac keeps quiet about his emotional pain, but wonders aloud to Rosa Lee why his once sorry existence has been given meaning and, on the other hand, his daughter has died. Throughout his mourning, Mac continues his new life with Rosa Lee and Sonny. Sonny eventually finds a football that Mac has left as a gift for him. Mac is watching the motel from a field across the road, singing the hymn to himself. Sonny thanks him for the football and the two play catch together as Rosa Lee watches them through a window.",
