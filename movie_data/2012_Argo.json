  "name": "Argo",
  "plot": "On November 4, 1979, Iranian Islamists storm the United States Embassy in Tehran in retaliation for the right of asylum granted by President Jimmy Carter to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , whose Western-supported monarchy was overthrown by the Iranian Revolution. Sixty-six embassy staff are taken hostage, but six avoid capture and are secretly sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor . The U.S. State Department explores options for exfiltrating them from Iran and consults Tony Mendez , a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist. He criticizes their proposals but offers no alternative until inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes . The cover story he crafts for the escapees requires them to pose as Canadian filmmakers scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film in Iran. On the advice of John Chambers , a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA, Mendez works with film producer Lester Siegel to create a phony film production company. They successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo , a \"science fantasy adventure\" in the style of Star Wars , to lend the cover story credibility. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and realize some personnel are unaccounted for. Posing as a producer for Argo , Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees, who are growing restless. He provides them Canadian passports and fake identities. They reluctantly go along, knowing that Mendez is also risking his own life. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when a hostile shopkeeper harasses them, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd. Mendez is told the operation has been canceled in favor of a planned military rescue of the hostages . He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss, Deputy Director Jack O'Donnell, to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and rebook their canceled tickets on a Swissair flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees' new ticket reservations are belatedly confirmed, and the head guard's call to the fake Hollywood production company is answered only at the last second. The escapees board the plane as airport authorities are alerted to the ruse, but fail to stop the plane from taking off. U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed to protect the remaining hostages from retaliation, and full credit is given to the Canadian government. Taylor shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife while their Iranian housekeeper escapes to Iraq . Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star , secretly due to the mission's classified nature, and returns to his wife and son in Virginia . A textual epilogue reveals that the remaining hostages were released after 444 days in captivity; Chambers, who received the Intelligence Medal of Merit, remained friends with Mendez until his death; and Mendez, whose Intelligence Star was returned to him after Bill Clinton declassified the Canadian Caper in 1997, lives with his family in rural Maryland.",
