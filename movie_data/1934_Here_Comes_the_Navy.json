  "plot": "Riveter \"Chesty\" O'Connor and his best friend \"Droopy\" join the US Navy to annoy O'Connor's nemesis, Chief Petty Officer \"Biff\" Martin. O'Connor gets himself court-martialed for being AWOL while visiting Martin's sister Dorothy. Disgruntled at his treatment, O'Connor angrily derides the Navy and finds himself ostracized by his fellow sailors in the USS Arizona . During gunnery practice, O'Connor puts out a fire in a 14 inch gun turret and receives the Navy Cross medal, but is still determined to get out of the Navy. Later, O'Connor transfers to the US Naval Air Service and is assigned to the rigid airship USS Macon . When the Macon tries to dock, Chief Martin is accidentally caught on a guide rope and is hoisted into the air. [ Note 1 ] Despite orders, O'Connor climbs down the rope and saves Martin's life by parachuting both of them to the ground. Later, at the wedding of O'Connor to Dorothy, Martin finds out that O'Connor has been promoted to warrant boatswain and now outranks him.",
