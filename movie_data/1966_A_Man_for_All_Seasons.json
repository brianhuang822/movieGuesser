  "plot": "The film covers the years 1529 to 1535, during the reign of Henry VIII . During a private late-night meeting at Hampton Court , Cardinal Wolsey , Lord Chancellor of England , chastises More for being the only member of the privy council to oppose Wolsey's attempts to obtain from the Pope an annulment of Henry VIII 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon , as their marriage has not produced a male heir. With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry Anne Boleyn , with whom he hopes to father such an heir and avoid a repeat of the Wars of the Roses . More says that he cannot agree to Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is being overheard by Wolsey's aide, Thomas Cromwell . Returning to his home at Chelsea at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance Richard Rich waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More instead offers Rich a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's offer, saying that teaching would offer him little chance to become well known. More finds his daughter Meg chatting with a brilliant young lawyer, William Roper , who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly Catholic More says he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a Lutheran . Wolsey is dismissed from office when the annulment is not granted and dies in disgrace in a rural monastery. More succeeds him as Lord Chancellor. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate and again requests More's support for an annulment, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. Cromwell, now the King's Principal Secretary , bribes Rich with the promise of a position at Court if he will spy on More. Roper, learning of More's quarrel with the king, says that his religious views have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the king has become \"the Devil's minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich again pleads for More to grant him an office. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Cromwell. An unmoved More responds, \"Of course, that's one of my servants.\" A humiliated Rich ends his friendship with More. Meanwhile, the king orders Parliament and the bishops to declare him \" Supreme Head of the Church of England \". Embracing Caesaropapism , the bishops and Parliament accede to the king's demands and renounce all allegiance to the Pope. More quietly resigns as Lord Chancellor rather than accept the new order. His close friend and successor, Thomas Howard , attempts to draw out his opinions in a friendly private chat, but More knows that the time for speaking openly of such matters is over. In a meeting with Norfolk, Cromwell implies that More's troubles will be over if he will attend the king's \"wedding\" to Boleyn. After More does not, he is summoned again to Hampton Court and interrogated mercilessly by Cromwell. More refuses to answer any questions, and an infuriated Cromwell sends him away. The Thames boatmen are aware of the King's hostility to More and refuse to ferry him, so More returns home on foot. As More finally arrives, his daughter Meg informs him that a new oath is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of high treason . Initially, More says he might be willing to take the oath, depending on its wording. Upon learning that it names the king as head of the Church, legitimizes his Lutheran heirs, and allows no legal or moral loopholes, More refuses to take it and is imprisoned in the Tower of London . At an inquiry chaired by Cromwell and Norfolk, More remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the king's supremacy. Cromwell punishes More by having his prized collection of books confiscated. As Rich collects the books, he and his former friend share a final debate over More's choices. More says goodbye to his wife Alice , Meg and Roper, urging them not to try to defend him, but to leave the country. At his trial, More refuses to express an opinion about the king's second marriage or why he will not take the Oath, based upon the legal principle that silence is to be interpreted as consent . Cromwell calls Rich to testify. Rich alleges that, when he went to confiscate More's books, More told him that while Parliament has the power to dethrone the king, it does not have the authority to make the king the Head of the Church. A horrified More offers to take any oath required by the court that he never said any such thing to Rich. More adds that he would never be so suicidal as to entrust so dangerous an opinion \"to such a man as that.\" As Rich leaves the witness box, it emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for Wales as a reward from Cromwell for committing perjury , much to More's chagrin. Under a direct order from Cromwell, the jury convicts More without leaving the courtroom to deliberate. But as the judges begin to pronounce the death penalty , More interrupts and reminds them that prisoners are to be asked before sentencing if they have anything to say. Upon being so asked by the judges, More declares, \"I do.\" More calls Parliament's Act of Supremacy repugnant to every legal precedent and institution in all the history of Christendom . He cites the Biblical foundation for the Petrine Primacy and the authority of the Papacy , rather than national governments, over the Church. Furthermore, he declares that the Church's freedom from state control and interference is guaranteed both in the Magna Carta and in the king's own coronation oath. As uproar ensues, the judges sentence More to death by beheading . The scene switches from the court to Tower Hill , where More observes custom by pardoning and tipping the executioner. More declares, \"I die his Majesty's good servant, but God's first.\" He kneels at the block and, off-screen, the executioner cuts off More's head. A narrator intones an epilogue, listing the subsequent untimely deaths of the major characters, apart from Rich, who \"became Chancellor of England, and died in his bed.\"",
