  "plot": "During the latter stages of World War II , in the city of Falkenheim [ a ] in Nazi Germany , ten-year-old Johannes \"Jojo\" Betzler joins the Deutsches Jungvolk . Heavily indoctrinated by Nazism , he has an imaginary friend named Adolf, a buffoonish version of Adolf Hitler . The local HJ training camp is run by the conflicted Captain Klenzendorf. Though a fanatic, Jojo is deemed weak and nicknamed \"Jojo Rabbit\" after being unable to kill a rabbit with his bare hands. Pepped up by Adolf, he returns to prove himself by throwing a Stielhandgranate during an exercise, only for it to explode at his feet, severely injuring himself. Jojo's mother Rosie insists to the now-demoted Klenzendorf that Jojo still be included, albeit be assigned small tasks around town while he recovers rather than continue at the camp. Alone at home one day, Jojo discovers Elsa Korr, a teenage Jewish girl and his late sister Inge's former friend, whom Rosie is hiding behind the walls of Inge's attic bedroom. He is both terrified of and aggressive towards Elsa. The two are left at an impasse , as the revelation of Rosie's hiding of Elsa would lead to the execution of all three of them. Inspired by an offhand rant by Klenzendorf, Jojo continues to interact with Elsa to uncover her \"Jew secrets\" and make a picture book titled Yoohoo Jew , [ b ] allowing people to easily recognize her kind. Despite this, he finds himself clashing with innocence, and slowly forming a friendship with her. Elsa is both saddened and amused by Jojo's radical beliefs, using surreal antisemitic tropes to challenge his dogmatism . Jojo slowly becomes infatuated with the strong-willed and kind teen, awkwardly forging love letters from her fianc√© Nathan, and begins questioning his beliefs, causing Adolf to scold him over his diminishing patriotism. Gradually, Rosie is revealed to be part of the German resistance to Nazism , spreading anti-Nazi messages around town. [ c ] One day while she is out, the Gestapo come to investigate; Klenzendorf arrives and helps Jojo and Elsa deceive the Gestapo regarding Elsa's identity. Later, Jojo finds Rosie has been hanged at the gallows in the public square, having been caught spreading the messages. Devastated, he returns home and tries to stab Elsa before breaking down in tears. She comforts him and also reveals that Jojo's lost father has been working against Hitler from abroad. Jojo's beliefs on Nazism quickly shift, as he sees the regime's inhumanity. With no money, Jojo begins to scavenge food for them both from waste bins around the city. Following the death of the real Hitler , the Allies initiate an offensive on Falkenheim. [ d ] Weakened, the civilian population including the Jungvolk is pressed into combat service. Jojo hides until it ends with an Allied victory. As a Jungvolk , Jojo is seized by the Soviet Red Army alongside Klenzendorf, who comforts him over the death of Rosie, tells him to look after Elsa, and tears off his Jungvolk coat while calling him a Jew so the Soviets do not harm him. After saving Jojo, Klenzendorf is executed by firing squad . Fearing that Elsa will leave him, Jojo tells her Germany won the war . Recognizing her despair, he forges a letter from Nathan claiming that he and Jojo have figured out a way to smuggle her to Paris . Elsa confesses that Nathan died of tuberculosis the previous year. Jojo tells Elsa he loves her and hopes that she loves him, even as a brother. Elsa tells him she loves him, as a brother. As Jojo goes to leave, Hitler reappears, now dishevelled and bearing a severe wound to the head , but Jojo erases him by knocking him out of a window. Outside, Elsa sees U.S. forces and realizes the truth, slapping Jojo in the face for lying. They then dance in the street together, now free.",
