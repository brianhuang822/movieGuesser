His primary support is Bobby, his manager and older half-brother. After a show, Jack goes out for drinks and visits a drag bar . There, Jack witnesses a tribute performance to Ã‰dith Piaf by 31-year-old Ally, who works as a waitress and singer-songwriter. He is amazed by her performance, and they spend the night talking, she Ally discusses her unsuccessful efforts in pursuing a professional music career. Ally shares with Jack some lyrics she has been working on, he tells her she is a talented songwriter and should perform her material. Jack invites Ally to his next show. Despite her initial refusal, she attends and, with Jack's encouragement, sings \" Shallow \" on stage with him. Jack invites Ally to go on tour with him, and they form a romantic relationship. In Arizona , Ally and Jack go to visit the ranch where Jack grew up and where his father is buried. However, they discover that Bobby had sold the land, which was converted into a wind farm . Angered at his betrayal, Jack attacks Bobby, who subsequently quits as his manager. Before doing so, Bobby reveals that he did inform Jack about the sale, but Jack was too drunk to notice. While on tour, Ally meets Rez, a record producer who offers her a contract. Although visibly bothered, Jack still supports her decision to sign with him. Rez refocuses Ally away from country music and towards pop . Jack misses one of Ally's performances after he passes out drunk in public. Jack recovers at the home of his best friend George \"Noodles\" Stone and later makes up with Ally. There, he proposes to her with an impromptu ring made from a loop of a guitar string. They are married that same day at a church ministered by a relative of Noodles. During Ally's performance on Saturday Night Live , Bobby reconciles with Jack. Later, Ally and a drunken Jack fight over Ally's growing artistic success. Jack criticizes Ally's new image and music, as her success is outpacing his recent decline in popularity. At the Grammy Awards , where Ally is nominated in three categories, a visibly intoxicated Jack performs a tribute to Roy Orbison . Later in the evening, she wins Best New Artist . As Ally is giving her acceptance speech, a still-inebriated Jack staggers up to her, where he publicly wets himself and passes out. Ally's father, Lorenzo, berates a semi-conscious Jack while Ally attempts to help Jack sober up. Jack joins a rehabilitation program shortly thereafter. He discloses to his counselor that he tried to commit suicide at age 12 and reveals his progressively worsening tinnitus . Jack tearfully apologizes to Ally for his behavior. While returning home, Jack admits to Bobby that it was he whom he idolized and not their father. Ally asks Rez to bring Jack on her European tour, but Rez refuses, prompting Ally to cancel the remainder of the tour to care for Jack. Rez confronts Jack and accuses him of nearly ruining Ally's career, stating that Jack will certainly relapse again, and that it is \"embarrassing\" she is married to him. That evening, Ally lies to Jack and tells him that her record label has canceled her tour so she can focus on her second album. Jack promises he will come to her concert that night, but after Ally leaves, he hangs himself in their garage. Grief-stricken and inconsolable after Jack's suicide, Ally is visited by Bobby, who tells her that the suicide was Jack's own choice. The closing scenes reveal a flashback of Jack working on a song about his love for Ally, which he never finished writing. Ally performs this song as a tribute to Jack, introducing herself for the first time as Ally Maine.",
